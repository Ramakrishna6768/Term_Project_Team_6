Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,82,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign,

Poem 2: ♫ The Assad Curse ♫,9,11q0ekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/11q0ekv/poem_2_the_assad_curse/,0,1678682900.0,"A Poem by created by the worlds smartest AI

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar
Poem 1: ♫ Where have they gone ♫,8,11q0eiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/11q0eiy/poem_1_where_have_they_gone/,2,1678682895.0,"A Poem by created by the worlds smartest AI

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,15,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I feel it in the oil fields.

 *Allah souria bashar ou bas*

I feel on the strategic hills.

*biji biji ypg*

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,82,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,13,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Basically ad honimem attacks and projecting.  
Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.  
What's the big deal with posting these memes on Reddit? Can anyone explain me?

Edit: Can you please explain me why are they so angry for a Le Merchant meme?

My tiny heval is already expressing her disdain for closed spaces like Turkish prisons by kicking me. 

However I havent been able to find anything that explains how tiny hevals have different requirements than regular babies. I would like to know if anyone here has any ideas on how my tiny heval can grow into a proud and culturally competent individual who also has a unibrow

I think im gonna get her enlisted in the YPJ as soon as shes old enough not to be emzirmeked. 14 is the other option",1642182329.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I feel it in the oil fields.

 *Allah souria bashar ou bas*

I feel on the strategic hills.

*biji biji ypg*

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I hope this post doesn’t trigger anyone. I’m just trying to learn. How exactly do Assadists defend the atrocities committed by Assad? I’ve only been exposed to Western media and it’s hard to find another side of the story. I hope I find that here.

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,15,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Basically ad honimem attacks and projecting.  
Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.  
What's the big deal with posting these memes on Reddit? Can anyone explain me?

Edit: Can you please explain me why are they so angry for a Le Merchant meme?   
Look at the comments. Unreal.

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

And im also the only person here who actually behaves like a blaspheming heathen infidel when im not busy expending my blood and sweat for haydar and hossein. What is your excuse? Do you live in america? Are you an aghazadeh? Are you a tehranjelesi? Do you smoke hash all day? Are you a vulgar angry nationalist? Are you surrounded by monarchist flags and mek posers all day? Do you drink vodka at strip clubs and pay the strippers to play allah surya bashar while they get naked and pole dance? Did you read the laveyan satanic bible from the propaganda branch of the church of the antichrist published by the synagogue of satan cover to cover at the age of 16 just so you could piss off your religious friends with more accuracy? WHAT IS YOUR EXCUSE FOR BEING MORE IDEOLOGICALLY DEGENERATE THAN ME? YOU DONT HAVE ONE ASSHOLE. YOU NEVER WILL. EVER.

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,82,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I hope this post doesn’t trigger anyone. I’m just trying to learn. How exactly do Assadists defend the atrocities committed by Assad? I’ve only been exposed to Western media and it’s hard to find another side of the story. I hope I find that here.

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,12,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't understand the butthurt when someone posts a meme about Jews on Reddit.,26,su711p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/su711p/i_dont_understand_the_butthurt_when_someone_posts/,33,1645047154.0,"I posted this meme, got dislikes and passive aggressive comments from some young Redditors that basically told me that i need to go outside. Basically ad honimem attacks and projecting.  
Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.  
What's the big deal with posting these memes on Reddit? Can anyone explain me?

Edit: Can you please explain me why are they so angry for a Le Merchant meme?   
Look at the comments. Unreal.

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I'm  in the process of collecting information on Syrian rebel groups to  analyze their alliances from 2013 to the current day, but am having a  very hard time finding much information as most articles/reports focus  on the early FSA. I'm looking for at least one paper written on the SNA,  SIG, and SSG (Individually if possible), but have had no luck as of  yet.

If  there are any particular (Academic) works you could point me to, that  would be amazing. (I would prefer English articles, but I'll accept  Turkish or Russian if there is no English version available)",1635268234.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,83,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar
Poem 2: ♫ The Assad Curse ♫,10,11q0ekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/11q0ekv/poem_2_the_assad_curse/,0,1678682900.0,"A Poem by created by the worlds smartest AI

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,16,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,84,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,12,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Basically ad honimem attacks and projecting.  
Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.  
What's the big deal with posting these memes on Reddit? Can anyone explain me?

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I feel it in the oil fields.

 *Allah souria bashar ou bas*

I feel on the strategic hills.

*biji biji ypg*

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,83,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

If you've seen the many posts from MSM news talking about ""These are not refugees from Iraq, Syria""   
and you hear some racist things. I noticed it sounds like they are reading from the same script.   


Have anyone thought the same and why do you think? It seems like they want to incite same new type of race war... Maybe using the Chechen army.. I don't know...",1646073395.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Basically ad honimem attacks and projecting.  
Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.  
What's the big deal with posting these memes on Reddit? Can anyone explain me?

Edit: Can you please explain me why are they so angry for a Le Merchant meme?

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,83,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I hope this post doesn’t trigger anyone. I’m just trying to learn. How exactly do Assadists defend the atrocities committed by Assad? I’ve only been exposed to Western media and it’s hard to find another side of the story. I hope I find that here.

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,12,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't understand the butthurt when someone posts a meme about Jews on Reddit.,28,su711p,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/su711p/i_dont_understand_the_butthurt_when_someone_posts/,33,1645047154.0,"I posted this meme, got dislikes and passive aggressive comments from some young Redditors that basically told me that i need to go outside. Basically ad honimem attacks and projecting.  
Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.  
What's the big deal with posting these memes on Reddit? Can anyone explain me?

Edit: Can you please explain me why are they so angry for a Le Merchant meme?   
Look at the comments. Unreal.

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I'm  in the process of collecting information on Syrian rebel groups to  analyze their alliances from 2013 to the current day, but am having a  very hard time finding much information as most articles/reports focus  on the early FSA.

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,81,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar
Poem 2: ♫ The Assad Curse ♫,8,11q0ekv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/11q0ekv/poem_2_the_assad_curse/,0,1678682900.0,"A Poem by created by the worlds smartest AI

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,14,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I feel it in the oil fields.

I feel on the strategic hills.

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,82,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,

My bullshit meter is off the charts regarding coverage of the Bucha massacre,12,tyeogl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/tyeogl/my_bullshit_meter_is_off_the_charts_regarding/,52,1649342857.0,"When news of the Bucha massacre broke, a lot of the coverage focused on the fact that some of the victims were shot with their hands tied behind their back. This supposedly made it clear that the killings were deliberate rather than ""collateral damage"", like one might otherwise assume.

Most of the photos were of this victim in a brown jacket: https://i.imgur.com/MPMdhDZ.jpg

I've also seen photos of another bound-and-shot victim in a black jacket.

Apart from those two, none of the other bodies appear to have been bound and nor do they show signs of being shot. The NYT says the “causes of death are unclear”, meaning that their photographer didn’t see bullet wounds. They note that three of the bodies are near an impact crater, suggesting shelling.

On Monday, the New York Times [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/04/world/europe/bucha-ukraine-bodies.html) (soft paywall, unfortunately) that satellite imagery shows that the bodies have been there since March 11, a time that Russia was in control of the area. The satellite images come from Maxar Technologies. (The New York Times says they were ""provided"" with the images. It does not say they *obtained* the images.)

>	The [satellite] images show dark objects of similar size to a human body appearing on Yablonska Street between March 9 and March 11. The objects appear in the precise positions in which the bodies were found after Ukrainian forces reclaimed Bucha, as the footage from April 1 shows. Further analysis shows that the objects remained in those position for over three weeks.
>	
>	The causes of death are unclear. Some of the bodies were beside what appears to be an impact crater. Others were near abandoned cars. Three of the bodies lay beside bicycles. Some have their hands bound behind their backs with white cloth. The bodies were scattered over more than half a mile of Yablonska Street.

The NYT made a video with a side-by-side comparison of the Ukrainian footage from April 1 and the satellite images, so you can see the bodies match. The satellite photos in the video are dated March 19.

The problem is, the famous body in the brown jacket isn't in the satellite photos. This absense is briefly (too briefly) noted on-screen in the NYT's video itself: https://i.imgur.com/MwT0xr1.jpg

Near the body in the brown jacket is a body in a blue jacket. The body in the blue jacket is in the satellite photos. The body in the brown jacket is not in the photos. That seems odd.

This body received a lot of media attention as supposed proof of Russia’s war crimes. If it wasn't there on March 19, when did it appear?  (And did the New York Times even ask?)

Did the bound-and-shot body appear before March 30, when Russians controlled the area? Or did it appear after March 31, after Russia left the area? This isn’t nitpicking. This detail is important. The narrative hinges on it.

The NYT story mentions that they saw satellite photos from March 20 and March 21 as well, so it sounds like Maxar Technologies has daily photos. Surely Maxar Technologies knows when the famous body in the brown jacket appeared. So if they have proof that the body appeared while the Russians were in control, why don’t they share it? Surely it would newsworthy. 

I might guess that the body was planted by Ukrainians on either March 31 or April 1. But why would they do that? I can only think of one reason: The Ukrainians were the ones who killed the civilians on Yablonska Street on March 10-11, probably unintentionally via shelling of the area. To cover up their mistake, they planted the bound-and-shot bodies (probably Russian POWs, or already-dead corpses) to make it look like a massacre by the Russians. Just as Russia claims.

Either way, Maxar Technologies has the proof about what happened. I wonder if we'll ever see it.",1649342857.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I have sat on 10 hours of footage since the Syrian ""civil war"" and spent 4 years exposing the lies after I donated money to White Helmets because I was seduced by the lies. But there are some speeches from H\_tler about NATO (October 16, 1939 I think) exposing that NATO was in the making already from the Balfour declaration 1918 if not earlier, that I can't find anymore for download.

In the speech he laughs when he reads Roosevelts accusations of ""H\_tler's new world order"" and mentions several countries like Palestine. And he makes a speech about the Arabs and how they are being captured by British military.

I also want the speech of Roosevelt addressing ""the secret map"" of H\_tler's New World Order because it fits NATO's expansion map.",1646139190.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

Basically ad honimem attacks and projecting.  
Taking unwanted traits they don't like about themselves and attributing them to someone else.

So, i work in an office job, i pay my bills, i fulfilled my duty for my country serving in the army (instead of avoiding) but apparently some spoiled young American Redditors know better about me, i guess.

I don't understand the butthurt of some people. You are literally on [**r/SyrianCirclejerkWar**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/)**.**  
Israel literally wants to destroy Syria and are using USA to do that. For 10 years and 11 months.  
What's the big deal with posting these memes on Reddit? Can anyone explain me?

Turkey continues to fail to comply with the Memorandum. In total, in November 2021, 258 attacks were recorded by terrorists against the positions of government troops from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone. 163 times, units of the armed forces of the SAR were subjected to mortar fire, 47 attacks were fired from artillery pieces and MLRS installations. The remaining cases of violation of the cessation of hostilities regime are associated with the use of small arms by illegal armed groups by militants.

As a result of the shelling of terrorists from the territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone in November 2021, seven Syrian soldiers were killed. Six of them became victims of militants' sniper fire. 24 Syrian military personnel were injured, including 14 Syrian soldiers were wounded by sniper shots.",1638387065.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

На данный момент одно из приоритетных направлений – это расселение лагерей беженцев. Только осенью этого года сирийским властям при поддержке ЦПВС удалось обеспечить жильем 1292 человека, которые проживали в 10 лагерях. Всего за 2021 год закрыты 26 мест временного проживания беженцев. 

Однако эта положительная тенденция прослеживается не на всей территории Сирии, в частности, только в лагере «Эль-Холь», который находится на неподконтрольной властям Сирии территории, проживают более 60 тысяч человек, у которых нет самого необходимого – продуктов питания, питьевой воды и элементарной медицинской помощи.

В то же время поддерживаемая США «автономная администрация северо-востока Сирии» не предпринимает мер по восстановлению гражданской инфраструктуры и разрушенного в ходе военных действий жилого фонда. Вследствие этого не менее 150 тысяч человек не имеют возможности вернуться в места прежнего проживания. Попытки перемещенных лиц покинуть лагеря беженцев пресекаются силовыми методами.",1636400371.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

According to an individual with access to the highest levels of major European governments, the intelligence services of these countries are reporting to their principals that the commanders of the Israeli military and intelligence community believe that the civil war in Syria is spreading to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey . These European officials are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Syria will lead to uprisings in these countries that will bring increasingly conservative Islamic regimes into power, replacing existing secular or moderate regimes. This individual adds that, Israeli security officials believe that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is convinced that these developments will leave them vulnerable, with only enemies on their borders.

**In private conversations senior Israeli Intelligence and Military commaders state to their European associates that they have long viewed the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad, while hostile, as a known quantity and a buffer between Israel and the more militant Muslim countries, a situation that is threatened by the growing successs of the rebel forces of the Free Syria Army (FSA).**

The Israelis were scared of a muslim victory in Syria, not the other way around. They knew Assad would never attack them, but the muslim brotherhood would.

I feel it in the oil fields.

 *Allah souria bashar ou bas*

I feel on the strategic hills.

*biji biji ypg*

I smell it in Douma.

Many accounts that once were here are now banned, for few posters now live who remember it.

It began with the CIA forging of the Arab Spring. Damascus, the cities, and the Coast were given to the Assadists; immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. 

The Kurdish lands and Northern cities were given to the YPG, great feminists and LGBT rights campaigners of Rojava. 

And six, six countries openly supported the Rebels, who above all else desire Sharia.

For within these factions was bound the instability and the weapons to make war. But they were all of them deceived, for another group was made.

 Deep in the land of Turkey, in his Ankara lair, the Dark Roach Erdogan forged a master faction, and into this militant group he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will to dominate all life.

One Islamic State to rule them all.


One by one, the free cities of Syria fell to the power of ISIS, but there were some who resisted. 

A last alliance of Syrian Soldiers and Kurds marched against the armies of ISIS, and in the streets of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, they fought for the freedom of Syria. Victory was near, but the power of ISIS could not be undone.

 It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Suheil, Brigadier General of Bashar, led his Tiger Forces.

ISIS, enemy of the free peoples of Earth, was defeated. Suheil went to Abu Duhur, to Ghouta, to Daraa, to Saraqib and Aleppo, and Turkey seemed defeated, but Trump is easily corrupted. And the genocidal intent of Erdogan has a will of its own...

Trump betrayed the YGP, and it killed Rojava.

And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. Warnings became perma-bans. Turks invaded the sub. And for two and a half years, ISIS passed out of all knowledge…",1630093920.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

I don't support the Assad regime, but I don't support the rebellion either. The only reason why I lean closer to the regime and slightly more sympathetic towards it primarily stems from the fact that it has popular support amongst its inhabitants and not the ikwanist elements fighting to overthrow his regime.

I don't go to r/islam but the hate the Assad regime receives is unreal in that subreddit whenever the talk of the ""unmah"" is brought up. They never for ONE second highlight how there are indentured slaves in the Muslim world. Or how countries like Qatar or Dubai literally starve people that work for their construction firms. No, Qatar is bad because it ""supports assad (lmao what??)"" and ""mah Uighurs maslimz, qatar supports the mega cock lords in Beijing in genojsidez 😡""

Inspite of the fact that the majority of the Sunnis that are fighting in this cluster fuck war that was thrown at Syria are fighting for Syrian arab army. Lmao

I seriously hate these people with a passion, there is no ummah when the vast majority of our countries are constantly turked and forced to prostitute itself to the big satan because the elites that rule over our nations sells us out to the west...Then sell us this meme ideology of an ummah to compensate for this fuckery.  Like bro, its almost as if they want muslims thrown into this weird cosmic abstraction that doesn't even entertain reality anymore. Because all these r/muslameen's tard brains only talk about praying and bringing this mythical ummah together.

Isn't Bashar al-Assad technically a modern day Roman emperor in many ways just not in name?,82,1ac5yys,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianCirclejerkWar/comments/1ac5yys/isnt_bashar_alassad_technically_a_modern_day/,24,1706342936.0,"I'm not a knowledgeable person about Rome so feel free to deconstruct my argument. I just had a sudden realization that Bashar al-Assad might be the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor. I know the good lads of this subreddit will help me find out if this belief is correct or not.

**But here's a case for why Bashar al-Assad is the closest thing to a modern day Roman emperor.**

* Syria was part of true Rome. Yes Greece and Italy are considered the real Rome, but Syria comes right after. Syria has great weather, great mix of cultures, the best cuisine in the world and was historically always one of Rome's richest provinces, unlike Britain.

* Hafez al-Assad fought so long in a turbulent, sectarian environment and was able to secure Presidency against all odds. Bashar al-Assad didn't have to work for it, he became President through family. Although he's had 100% real elections to secure his leadership.

* Is the leader of a country that has had civil unrest for the last 1000 years because of it's rich diversity and environmental/geopolitical advantages for foreigners. Has to constantly put down rebellions and deal with a myriad of ethnic, tribal, and sectarian issues. Despite this, he is attempting to protect all groups.

* Enemy of the Ottomans but didn't lose.

* Syrian soldiers still do the Roman salute, sucking the poison out that the evil Europeans injected.

* Has trusted Assyrian and Armenian advisors in high positions, government, military etc.

* Pushes ""propaganda"" that Syrians are all Syrian Arabs to remove perceived differences. Aka you're not a Sunni, Shia, Alawite, Armenian, Kurd, Circassian, Turkmen, etc..., you're a Roman!

**Arguments against:**

* Allied with the Persians, a historical enemy of Rome.

* Greece and Italy exists. Although Greece is a weak argument, real Romans would take Constantinople back. 

* Lacks perception, both foreign and Syrian, of being an important part of Rome for over 1000 years.


*Help me come out with more pros and cons to this argument. The reason I'm trying to push this is because whenever somebody calls him a dictator I call him the one true emperor of Rome.*",1706342936.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Hama Offensive of 2017 ♫

&#x200B;

 In Syria's troubled, war-torn land, 

 The Hama Offensive took its stand, 

 A battle fought with blood and tears, 

 And fueled by hate and extremist fears. 

&#x200B;

 The rebels came with fire and might, 

 Their cause, they thought, was just and right, 

 But in their midst, extremism brewed, 

 A poison that would soon intrude. 

&#x200B;

 The army fought with brutal force, 

 Determined to stay the rebels' course, 

 But in the midst of all the fray, 

 Extremism led the rebels' way. 

&#x200B;

 The city shook with death and pain, 

 As both sides fought to seize the gain, 

 But in the end, the rebels fell, 

 Their cause undone by their own zeal. 

&#x200B;

 The cost was great, the price was steep, 

 As Syria's wounds ran dark and deep, 

 And though the battle may be done, 

 The specter of extremism still hung. 

&#x200B;

 For in the midst of all the strife, 

 The seeds of hate had come to life, 

 And though the war may ebb and flow, 

 The poison of extremism will still grow. 

&#x200B;

 So let us pray for peace to reign, 

 And call for love to break the chain, 

 Of hate and fear that grip the land, 

 And end the cycle of Syria's stand.",1678682913.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ The Assad Curse ♫  


The Assad curse, a dark and potent force  
That grips the land and leaves no room for remorse  
Those who speak out against its iron grip  
Find themselves silenced, or given the slip

One day an important voice arose  
Demanding that the Syrian leader be deposed  
Bashar Al-Assad, he must go, they said  
But the curse, it struck, and that person was dead

Or maybe they disappeared, no one knows for sure  
The Assad curse, its power is obscure  
But what is clear, is that those who stand  
Against the curse, they face a deadly hand

The people cry out for justice and for peace   
But the curse remains, and its grip will not release  
 The world looks on, but turns a blind eye  
To the suffering and pain, to the tears they cry   


 The Assad curse, a shadow on the land  
 A leader's rule, that cannot understand  
 The hopes and dreams of those he rules   
 Their voices silenced, like broken tools   


 But still, they fight on, with hope in their heart  
 That one day the curse will be torn apart  
 And freedom and justice will finally reign  
 And the curse of Assad will forever wane.",1678682900.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar

♫ Where have they gone ♫

Where have they gone, /u/Dr_Nooooo and Arrab-morrocan,  
In a land torn apart by war and destruction,  
Their absence felt deeply, a loss so profound,  
In a country where hope is scarce and unfound.

But still, /u/Melonskal fights on,  
Against the forces of evil, he stands strong,  
With every breath,he fights for what is right,  
Amidst the chaos, he is a beacon of light.

/u/Chester_T_Molester, a predator in the night,  
Feeding on the weak, a source of blight,  
And yet, in the darkness, there is still hope,  
/u/regionalfire, with courage to cope.

/u/Woofers_MacBarkFloof, a defender of truth,  
In the face of hate, he refuses to be subdued,  
With each passing day, he fights on,  
Amidst the turmoil, until the darkness is gone.

But the war rages on, with no end in sight,  
As forces clash in a never-ending fight,  
/u/blogsofjihad, spreading hate and fear,  
As innocent lives are lost, year after year.

/u/sigurdz, with a spirit unbroken,  
/u/hanihamawi, with courage so pure,   
Fights on, for the words left unspoken,   
They fight for justice, for a future secure,   


 /u/nadiahamilton and /u/WhoCares223 with soul so strong,   
Fights for the weak, against all that is wrong,

/u/WarmBullet and /u/yankedoodle, with heart so brave,  
They no longer wish for Isis to shave

/u/Pruswa, /u/lexidexi, and /u/ThatTwitterHandle,  
Each one fighting, with a heart so pure and able.

And still, we wonder where /u/pplswar has gone,  
In a land where hope is so hard to come upon,  
Their voice, once heard, now silenced by war,  
As the people of Syria continue to endure.

 /u/Makaveli533 was his name,  
A hero in this deadly game,  
Who fought for freedom, peace, and love,  
And never gave up on his brave dove. 

May peace come soon to this land of strife,  
And the wounds of war be healed in this life,  
May the voices of hope rise up once more,  
And the people of Syria find peace forevermore.",1678682895.0,SyrianCirclejerkWar
