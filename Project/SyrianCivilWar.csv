And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time. 

Remember don’t be fooled, just because Iran retaliated doesn’t make the IR good. We need to think with logic, not emotion if we’re to have success in this ummah. ",1713764397.0,AskMiddleEast

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,11,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

Iran closed the airspace for an hour, and then they opened it again. 

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal.

now the middle east was greatly influenced by islam throughout their history, so how did this fashion develop? this is the exact opposite of what muslim men are taught to have. i kind of get it in türkiye where you had atatürk and so on, but the arab nations? does anyone know where this fashion came from and why it is/ was so popular, despite opposing islam so directly?

-I'm seeking further education so I'd probably try to enroll in a local university for Master's or a post-grad diploma.

He’s a selfless person who puts others kindness before his. Even the small things like making me lunch after we go university. We play football together as well.

However, ever since the attack people have been taking go’s at me for being friends with him. I like his character and he’s a brother to me. I overlooked his Israeli heritage.

We joke about it saying he’s a coloniser etc for funny stuff but now people are serious. They have started to distance themselves from me. Or say I can go to parties only as long as he isn’t there.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,13,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic?

Overthrowing the king has no guarantee that we will replace with someone who will take a “tough” stand against Israel. on the off chance we do get a good leader Jordan is still militarily and economically weak, heavily reliant on foreign aid.

Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Do you think this shows Iranian strength?

Do you think this will deter Israeli escalation?

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture. They are an important part of this region and make up a significant portion of the population.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.

I am a trainee journalist at the University of Central Lancashire and I am looking to create a feature piece centred around both the potential future of the Palestinian/Israeli geographical area and the history behind the region. 

In short, i was wondering if anyone with an educational background or links to any relevant organisations would be willing to speak to me on the subject matter. This pice is also going to be nuanced.

An interview of this matter would only require a transcript so please do not be afraid of having your image shown on video and it would only take up roughly 10-15 minutes of your time.

Please let me know by commenting or sending me a message if this is something that you would be interested in helping with.

Thank you for your time.",1712925737.0,AskMiddleEast

Like Saudi Arabia (as I heard) happens to be the responsible for hundreds of thousands of starving Yemeni children that lead to their death (الله يحرمهم) 

UAE, that is supporting and funding millions of dollars to continue the silent genocide in Sudan in order to steal their gold

The rest of Arabian gulf (except Oman probably) doing slavery labor 

Or Indonesia committing genocide against West Papua citizens.

Haaretz - Saying What Can't Be Said: Israel Has Been Defeated – a Total Defeat,58,1c255se,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c255se/haaretz_saying_what_cant_be_said_israel_has_been/,11,1712915447.0,"https://preview.redd.it/91fvdauxs0uc1.jpg?width=2066&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=893cc05f192981c592ded13413d1ac179e4163a6

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Official estimates based on the Israel social security data point out that at least 370 Israeli security forces were eliminated on October 7th.,41,1bzde7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzde7q/serious_discussion_why_isnt_anyone_talking_about/,18,1712619873.0,"Why is this fact always ignored by the media? Shortly after October 7th the media was sooooo eager to relay propaganda about 40 beheaded babies etc. Yet two months later (Dec 2023) When Official data was released the media just stopped going into detail, yet hasn't changed the narrative about October 7th.

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas ! I feel like they are becoming an establishment with the resistance as a finality not a mean to achieve statehood, just like PLO became after Arafat.

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,22,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no.

"What if the French became more brutal during the Revolution in Algeria, if not outright genocidal? Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American. 

What TV series would you recommend that might be relatable to an American/Western audience? Could be anything from action to drama to comedy. My personal favorite series is Al-Hayba, but that probably doesn’t portray Lebanon in the most positive light.",1711824236.0,AskMiddleEast

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time. 

Remember don’t be fooled, just because Iran retaliated doesn’t make the IR good. We need to think with logic, not emotion if we’re to have success in this ummah. ",1713764397.0,AskMiddleEast

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

My mom had ticket to go to Iran today (emergency situation and she has to go) with Turkish airlines and they told us at lax airport that all of the Turkish flights from Istanbul to any city of Iran is cancelled for next 48 hours (April 21). 
However on Turkish website still not showing anything about this cancellation. They didn't send us any text, emails or any sort of communications.  Even their customer service didn't have any ideas about this and they told me there is not cancellation or delay. I had to ask the people at Turkish airlines gate at airport to talk with customer service on phone and explain the situation! 

Anyone know what is going on? They were flying almost every day since April 1st and all of the sudden they decided to stop? Maybe something serious is going on? 

And also do you guys know if Emirates still has any flights to Iran? On their website is showing that they have flight to Iran however I am not sure if it's real. They don't answer any calls at this time. ",1713596383.0,AskMiddleEast

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,15,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

Iran closed the airspace for an hour, and then they opened it again. 

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal.

-I'm a (white) Muslim with a black (Kenyan-Canadian) wife. Both in our late 20s, trying to have children before 30 inshaallah. She's very western in her demeanor and works as a nurse.

-English native speaker, pretty weak with other languages (French is poor; MSA going slowly, spoken Arabic or any other local language will also be slow-going because I'm not great at learning things ""by ear""). 

-I'm seeking further education so I'd probably try to enroll in a local university for Master's or a post-grad diploma.

Now if Hezbollah just had a bunch of weapons and used them against israeli planes or soldiers that crossed into Lebanese territory, I would buy that, but their recent conflict against Israel was started by them, with the purpose of helping their allies in Gaza according to them.

So how does this protect Lebanon? Almost 600 lebanese people have died so far, about 60 of them civilians. 100k lebanese have been displaced.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,15,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

This is an absolute requirement to put an end to the feeling of injustice, colonialism and ethnic cleansing.  - Israel must abandon its character of Jewish ethno-nationalism, such a racist vision is outdated and conflicting.  - the Merger of Israel, Gaza, the West Bank into a single state.  The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Overthrowing the king has no guarantee that we will replace with someone who will take a “tough” stand against Israel. on the off chance we do get a good leader Jordan is still militarily and economically weak, heavily reliant on foreign aid.

Iran’s attack seemed planned to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle | CNN,18,1c3wvuj,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/middleeast/iran-israel-attack-drones-analysis-intl/index.html,17,1713110395.0,"""The style of attack is reminiscent of Tehran’s response to former President Donald Trump’s targeted killing of Iran’s most storied general, Qassem Soleimani, in January 2020. Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Do you think this shows Iranian strength?

Do you think this will deter Israeli escalation?

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

2024-120(x4)=1544 [Genesis 6:3]

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture. They are an important part of this region and make up a significant portion of the population.

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.


That’s all I got in my head at the moment, let me know what you guys think would happen

Unpopular opinion : The Mullahs of Iran should just swallow their pride and not disrupt the tempo. They are already winning.,1,1c2ml4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c2ml4y/unpopular_opinion_the_mullahs_of_iran_should_just/,4,1712961809.0,"Social media is inundated with posts urging for Irani escalation, yet the majority of these voices lack the tangible opposition to occupation that Iran represents. Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

&#x200B;

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Western governments have always believed that the security of their colonial project in the middle east is only granted through instating obedient dictators and monarchs who know very well that Israel's security is a priority and are ready to suppress their people to oblivion to achieve this goal.

Deal with religious plurality in MENA,0,1c2eqr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c2eqr1/deal_with_religious_plurality_in_mena/,5,1712942239.0,"I think that the problem of the place of religion in the Middle East requires a middle ground solution.  Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.  Ps: I know that this system could have existed in the Ottoman or Mughal empire, it is not a question of copying the past but of drawing inspiration.",1712942239.0,AskMiddleEast

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me. 

If you have any questions please ask me before assuming… but I just can’t sit here and not share this when they wish for me to share what I can with the world…. ",1712825135.0,AskMiddleEast

Why didn't secularism take off in the Arab World the way that it did in Turkey?,0,1c09cxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c09cxo/why_didnt_secularism_take_off_in_the_arab_world/,7,1712712536.0," Kemal Ataturk was a devout Muslim, but was a staunch believer of separating religion and state affairs and was implementing stuff similar to the *Laicite* in France today. There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Hi everyone! I created my very first video yesterday. My goal is to document all war crimes committed against the Palestinians before the 7 October attack. I believe that people across the world need to know more how Israel “blatantly violated international laws” and why there is no accountability for their genocidal crimes. 

What do you think?

We see in the West a rapid death of Christianity. Having lived in France, Germany and England, I can tell you that among Europeans of Christian origin, religion is considered a relic of the past.  I remember when I was in middle school, the kids were shocked that I was truly a believer.  Will Islamic civilization take the same path as the West?  I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested. Any hot-headed defending of Harry will scream monarchy fetishism without analyzing the quality of skill and if it's getting people killed (their skill is extremely low, their strategy is extremely parasitic, and yes, it is getting people killed) and won't be considered.",1712413424.0,AskMiddleEast

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,76,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,25,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

Seriously, why all this hostility? Liberalism is about freedom and equality. Free speech, free press, freedom of religion and equality between everyone including Muslims and non-Muslims. Liberal values are the reason why many Muslims practice their religion in many non-Muslim countries. Are we going to demand liberal values in other countries but demand sharia in our countries? Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American. 

What TV series would you recommend that might be relatable to an American/Western audience? Could be anything from action to drama to comedy. My personal favorite series is Al-Hayba, but that probably doesn’t portray Lebanon in the most positive light.",1711824236.0,AskMiddleEast

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time.

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,10,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

The situation in Iran was calm, the AD engaged with some quadcopters over isfahan and they managed to shoot them down. 

Iran closed the airspace for an hour, and then they opened it again. 

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal. 

There are some pictures of what appears to be boosters in iraq but that's unclear for now.

I cant find data on how many lebanese have been injured or how much propert has been destroyed or damaged but its definitely more than 0. Would any of this happened if they chose not to attack Israel? Im guessing no. How is their involvement in the Gaza war making Lebanon safer?",1713392002.0,AskMiddleEast

We joke about it saying he’s a coloniser etc for funny stuff but now people are serious. They have started to distance themselves from me. Or say I can go to parties only as long as he isn’t there.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,13,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

A peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict :  Swiss model,18,1c59lwy,https://i.redd.it/nxdlqaw3hsuc1.jpeg,9,1713250419.0,"  I thought that the resolution of the conflict goes through several obligatory stages: -The return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1947. This is an absolute requirement to put an end to the feeling of injustice, colonialism and ethnic cleansing.  - Israel must abandon its character of Jewish ethno-nationalism, such a racist vision is outdated and conflicting.  - the Merger of Israel, Gaza, the West Bank into a single state.  The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Were you impressed by the Iranian response or did it leave you with the impression that Iran was too scared to fight a war against the West?  Eg. Zero Israeli casualties in response to the bombing of sovereign Iranian territory that killed an Iranian general

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

Edit: I'm specifically curious what people from the mena region or the diaspora from the region think of the attack.

If you are not of the mena region in some way please pick the results option, as I did.

My friend is pregnant and can't have abortion in her country as it's illegal and she is not married.
She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Please answer with respect this is not a joke, and no I'm not the father I'm just a friend trying to help.",1713152585.0,AskMiddleEast

Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Is there anything about a Sixth Covenant in Arabic/Islamic tradition?,2,1c3pixd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c3pixd/is_there_anything_about_a_sixth_covenant_in/,3,1713086694.0,"Hey all, I've been contributing to this sub and the Palestine sub since Oct-Nov 2023 as an non-Arab foreigner. I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

2024-480=1544 [1 Kings 6:1]  
2024-120(x4)=1544 [Genesis 6:3]

Btw here's my friend's prediction for if the US enters into conflict with Iran (and if the red heifers are slain), he and several others saw or dreamt of an event from the skies:

""I saw the West Coast hit by quakes unlike any other and there was a roaring sound in the sky during it, the atmosphere became as if heavy like a great weight was put on top of everything.

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.  Ps: I know that this system could have existed in the Ottoman or Mughal empire, it is not a question of copying the past but of drawing inspiration.",1712942239.0,AskMiddleEast

[https://archive.ph/DkYat](https://archive.ph/DkYat)

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me. 

If you have any questions please ask me before assuming… but I just can’t sit here and not share this when they wish for me to share what I can with the world…. ",1712825135.0,AskMiddleEast

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas !

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

We intend to have it split between two days, katb kitab in the masjid, and the second day will be a smaller party in a banquet hall dinner of about 100 people (it was really hard to limit it to be this small but it's what we wanted). I would love to know even the smallest basic etiquette, both cultural and non cultural, that I should have when going to the wedding, what's expected of me, and what do I bring. I know I have to bring flowers, but how many? Do I get some for her whole family? Do I need to say something in particular to her parents? Her mom? Her family members? What kind of mannerisms should I exhibit? Any kind of dance moves I should learn outside of Dabke? Every little etiquette you can think of, I would love to know.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

If they were really serious about it they wouldn't say openly they're gonna smuggle weapons to Jordan because now the monarchic regime will just send more police and army to the Syria and Iraq borders to prevent it from happening.

I'm not saying the Islamic Resistance in Iraq is bad in general because of that though, I support their armed actions against American bases in Iraq and Syria and against Isn'treal

Is secularism the solution,25,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Seriously, why all this hostility? Liberalism is about freedom and equality. Free speech, free press, freedom of religion and equality between everyone including Muslims and non-Muslims. Liberal values are the reason why many Muslims practice their religion in many non-Muslim countries. Are we going to demand liberal values in other countries but demand sharia in our countries? Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time.

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,11,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal.

i asked myself this question forever really. so if you see arabs or turks nowadays and on historical fotographs youll notice that the most common fashion to wear the beard is with everything shaved except for the moustache, which is kept well groomed.
now the middle east was greatly influenced by islam throughout their history, so how did this fashion develop? this is the exact opposite of what muslim men are taught to have. i kind of get it in türkiye where you had atatürk and so on, but the arab nations? does anyone know where this fashion came from and why it is/ was so popular, despite opposing islam so directly?

-English native speaker, pretty weak with other languages (French is poor; MSA going slowly, spoken Arabic or any other local language will also be slow-going because I'm not great at learning things ""by ear""). 

-I'm seeking further education so I'd probably try to enroll in a local university for Master's or a post-grad diploma.

However, ever since the attack people have been taking go’s at me for being friends with him. I like his character and he’s a brother to me. I overlooked his Israeli heritage.

We joke about it saying he’s a coloniser etc for funny stuff but now people are serious. They have started to distance themselves from me. Or say I can go to parties only as long as he isn’t there. 

Really hurts but I’m also conflicted slightly because he does support his country afterall.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,14,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic?

Iran’s attack seemed planned to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle | CNN,19,1c3wvuj,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/middleeast/iran-israel-attack-drones-analysis-intl/index.html,17,1713110395.0,"""The style of attack is reminiscent of Tehran’s response to former President Donald Trump’s targeted killing of Iran’s most storied general, Qassem Soleimani, in January 2020. Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Do you think this shows Iranian strength?

Do you think this will deter Israeli escalation?

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture. They are an important part of this region and make up a significant portion of the population.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

Unpopular opinion : The Mullahs of Iran should just swallow their pride and not disrupt the tempo.

Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

&#x200B;

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

&#x200B;

Western governments have always believed that the security of their colonial project in the middle east is only granted through instating obedient dictators and monarchs who know very well that Israel's security is a priority and are ready to suppress their people to oblivion to achieve this goal.

Deal with religious plurality in MENA,0,1c2eqr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c2eqr1/deal_with_religious_plurality_in_mena/,5,1712942239.0,"I think that the problem of the place of religion in the Middle East requires a middle ground solution.  Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

The doctrine of Hamas regarding the long standing conflict,4,1bzb5k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzb5k5/the_doctrine_of_hamas_regarding_the_long_standing/,11,1712614328.0,"I hear today Hamas's (or maybe Hamas supporters IDK) response to the ceasefire proposed by the US and Israel . I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas ! I feel like they are becoming an establishment with the resistance as a finality not a mean to achieve statehood, just like PLO became after Arafat.   
Do you feel the same ?

I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,27,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

How flawed hamas in your opinion,0,1bt9fwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bt9fwe/how_flawed_hamas_in_your_opinion/,5,1711991553.0,"I did used to ask this quite long ago ( well more like i used to ask how did some of you view hamas ) but the respond seems lacking. So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

About 80 percent of the population of the island are Greek cypriots. After an attempted coup in Nicosia Turkey invaded the north of the country to safeguard the status quo, but they still occupy north Cyprus, and have moved settlers from Anatolia to the north. I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American. 

What TV series would you recommend that might be relatable to an American/Western audience? Could be anything from action to drama to comedy. My personal favorite series is Al-Hayba, but that probably doesn’t portray Lebanon in the most positive light.",1711824236.0,AskMiddleEast

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time.

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,13,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

Iran closed the airspace for an hour, and then they opened it again. 

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal.

Now if Hezbollah just had a bunch of weapons and used them against israeli planes or soldiers that crossed into Lebanese territory, I would buy that, but their recent conflict against Israel was started by them, with the purpose of helping their allies in Gaza according to them.

So how does this protect Lebanon? Almost 600 lebanese people have died so far, about 60 of them civilians. 100k lebanese have been displaced. I cant find data on how many lebanese have been injured or how much propert has been destroyed or damaged but its definitely more than 0.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,15,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

A peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict :  Swiss model,18,1c59lwy,https://i.redd.it/nxdlqaw3hsuc1.jpeg,9,1713250419.0,"  I thought that the resolution of the conflict goes through several obligatory stages: -The return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1947. This is an absolute requirement to put an end to the feeling of injustice, colonialism and ethnic cleansing.  - Israel must abandon its character of Jewish ethno-nationalism, such a racist vision is outdated and conflicting.  - the Merger of Israel, Gaza, the West Bank into a single state.  The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

And I must say, good on Oman for not participating in the land route to Israel. Huge respect tbf.

At this point, not that it'd be surprising, an Israeli escelation will be simply one more step toward economic suicide. Iranian-produced weaponry is rather cheap compared to what Israel pays to intercept them.

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

2024-480=1544 [1 Kings 6:1]  
2024-120(x4)=1544 [Genesis 6:3]

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.  Ps: I know that this system could have existed in the Ottoman or Mughal empire, it is not a question of copying the past but of drawing inspiration.",1712942239.0,AskMiddleEast

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me. 

If you have any questions please ask me before assuming… but I just can’t sit here and not share this when they wish for me to share what I can with the world…. ",1712825135.0,AskMiddleEast

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

A Plea for Patience,3,1bzmf3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzmf3w/a_plea_for_patience/,2,1712648591.0,"Understanding the Complexity of Arab Leaders' Silence on Palestine

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

Is the online campaign that Sweden kidnaps muslim children prevalent in the Middle East?,0,1bvvn16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bvvn16/is_the_online_campaign_that_sweden_kidnaps_muslim/,5,1712257451.0,"So what basically has happened is that a few immigrant families had their children removed by the social services, because they either slap their children, which is super illegal here, even a small slap on their bottom can get you jailed, pulling their children from school, which is also super illegal here, and such. 

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Last I heard, they were trying to spread this message around to a Middle-eastern channels, to spread the word.

Have you seen this campaign in any middle eastern channel? How prevalent in this campaign?",1712257451.0,AskMiddleEast

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Who do you think developed numerals? Was it a joint effort by Hindus from India and Arabs, a pure Hindu invention or an invention of the Islamic Golden Age?",1712131107.0,AskMiddleEast

Is secularism the solution,22,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian.

Seriously, why all this hostility? Liberalism is about freedom and equality. Free speech, free press, freedom of religion and equality between everyone including Muslims and non-Muslims. Liberal values are the reason why many Muslims practice their religion in many non-Muslim countries. Are we going to demand liberal values in other countries but demand sharia in our countries? Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time. 

Remember don’t be fooled, just because Iran retaliated doesn’t make the IR good. We need to think with logic, not emotion if we’re to have success in this ummah. ",1713764397.0,AskMiddleEast

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

  
edit: it’s really ironic how after (what feels like) our government opening McDonalds left and right we end up boycotting them.",1713653313.0,AskMiddleEast

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,13,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all.

i asked myself this question forever really. so if you see arabs or turks nowadays and on historical fotographs youll notice that the most common fashion to wear the beard is with everything shaved except for the moustache, which is kept well groomed.
now the middle east was greatly influenced by islam throughout their history, so how did this fashion develop? this is the exact opposite of what muslim men are taught to have. i kind of get it in türkiye where you had atatürk and so on, but the arab nations? does anyone know where this fashion came from and why it is/ was so popular, despite opposing islam so directly?

-I'm seeking further education so I'd probably try to enroll in a local university for Master's or a post-grad diploma.

He’s a selfless person who puts others kindness before his. Even the small things like making me lunch after we go university. We play football together as well.

However, ever since the attack people have been taking go’s at me for being friends with him. I like his character and he’s a brother to me. I overlooked his Israeli heritage.

We joke about it saying he’s a coloniser etc for funny stuff but now people are serious. They have started to distance themselves from me. Or say I can go to parties only as long as he isn’t there.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,15,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Overthrowing the king has no guarantee that we will replace with someone who will take a “tough” stand against Israel. on the off chance we do get a good leader Jordan is still militarily and economically weak, heavily reliant on foreign aid.

Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Do you think this shows Iranian strength?

Do you think this will deter Israeli escalation?

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture. They are an important part of this region and make up a significant portion of the population.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

&#x200B;

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.

I am a trainee journalist at the University of Central Lancashire and I am looking to create a feature piece centred around both the potential future of the Palestinian/Israeli geographical area and the history behind the region. 

In short, i was wondering if anyone with an educational background or links to any relevant organisations would be willing to speak to me on the subject matter. This pice is also going to be nuanced.

An interview of this matter would only require a transcript so please do not be afraid of having your image shown on video and it would only take up roughly 10-15 minutes of your time.

Please let me know by commenting or sending me a message if this is something that you would be interested in helping with.

Thank you for your time.",1712925737.0,AskMiddleEast

Like Saudi Arabia (as I heard) happens to be the responsible for hundreds of thousands of starving Yemeni children that lead to their death (الله يحرمهم)

The rest of Arabian gulf (except Oman probably) doing slavery labor

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities.

Official estimates based on the Israel social security data point out that at least 370 Israeli security forces were eliminated on October 7th.,40,1bzde7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzde7q/serious_discussion_why_isnt_anyone_talking_about/,18,1712619873.0,"Why is this fact always ignored by the media? Shortly after October 7th the media was sooooo eager to relay propaganda about 40 beheaded babies etc. Yet two months later (Dec 2023) When Official data was released the media just stopped going into detail, yet hasn't changed the narrative about October 7th.

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas ! I feel like they are becoming an establishment with the resistance as a finality not a mean to achieve statehood, just like PLO became after Arafat.

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,26,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no.

"What if the French became more brutal during the Revolution in Algeria, if not outright genocidal? Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American. 

What TV series would you recommend that might be relatable to an American/Western audience? Could be anything from action to drama to comedy. My personal favorite series is Al-Hayba, but that probably doesn’t portray Lebanon in the most positive light.",1711824236.0,AskMiddleEast

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time. 

Remember don’t be fooled, just because Iran retaliated doesn’t make the IR good. We need to think with logic, not emotion if we’re to have success in this ummah. ",1713764397.0,AskMiddleEast

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

My mom had ticket to go to Iran today (emergency situation and she has to go) with Turkish airlines and they told us at lax airport that all of the Turkish flights from Istanbul to any city of Iran is cancelled for next 48 hours (April 21). 
However on Turkish website still not showing anything about this cancellation. They didn't send us any text, emails or any sort of communications.  Even their customer service didn't have any ideas about this and they told me there is not cancellation or delay. I had to ask the people at Turkish airlines gate at airport to talk with customer service on phone and explain the situation! 

Anyone know what is going on? They were flying almost every day since April 1st and all of the sudden they decided to stop? Maybe something serious is going on? 

And also do you guys know if Emirates still has any flights to Iran? On their website is showing that they have flight to Iran however I am not sure if it's real. They don't answer any calls at this time. ",1713596383.0,AskMiddleEast

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,12,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

Iran closed the airspace for an hour, and then they opened it again. 

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal.

-I'm a (white) Muslim with a black (Kenyan-Canadian) wife. Both in our late 20s, trying to have children before 30 inshaallah. She's very western in her demeanor and works as a nurse.

-English native speaker, pretty weak with other languages (French is poor; MSA going slowly, spoken Arabic or any other local language will also be slow-going because I'm not great at learning things ""by ear""). 

-I'm seeking further education so I'd probably try to enroll in a local university for Master's or a post-grad diploma.

Now if Hezbollah just had a bunch of weapons and used them against israeli planes or soldiers that crossed into Lebanese territory, I would buy that, but their recent conflict against Israel was started by them, with the purpose of helping their allies in Gaza according to them.

So how does this protect Lebanon? Almost 600 lebanese people have died so far, about 60 of them civilians. 100k lebanese have been displaced.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,14,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

This is an absolute requirement to put an end to the feeling of injustice, colonialism and ethnic cleansing.  - Israel must abandon its character of Jewish ethno-nationalism, such a racist vision is outdated and conflicting.  - the Merger of Israel, Gaza, the West Bank into a single state.  The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Overthrowing the king has no guarantee that we will replace with someone who will take a “tough” stand against Israel. on the off chance we do get a good leader Jordan is still militarily and economically weak, heavily reliant on foreign aid.

Iran’s attack seemed planned to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle | CNN,19,1c3wvuj,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/middleeast/iran-israel-attack-drones-analysis-intl/index.html,17,1713110395.0,"""The style of attack is reminiscent of Tehran’s response to former President Donald Trump’s targeted killing of Iran’s most storied general, Qassem Soleimani, in January 2020. Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Do you think this shows Iranian strength?

Do you think this will deter Israeli escalation?

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

2024-120(x4)=1544 [Genesis 6:3]

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture. They are an important part of this region and make up a significant portion of the population.

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.


That’s all I got in my head at the moment, let me know what you guys think would happen

Unpopular opinion : The Mullahs of Iran should just swallow their pride and not disrupt the tempo. They are already winning.,3,1c2ml4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c2ml4y/unpopular_opinion_the_mullahs_of_iran_should_just/,4,1712961809.0,"Social media is inundated with posts urging for Irani escalation, yet the majority of these voices lack the tangible opposition to occupation that Iran represents. Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

&#x200B;

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Western governments have always believed that the security of their colonial project in the middle east is only granted through instating obedient dictators and monarchs who know very well that Israel's security is a priority and are ready to suppress their people to oblivion to achieve this goal.

Deal with religious plurality in MENA,0,1c2eqr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c2eqr1/deal_with_religious_plurality_in_mena/,5,1712942239.0,"I think that the problem of the place of religion in the Middle East requires a middle ground solution.  Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.  Ps: I know that this system could have existed in the Ottoman or Mughal empire, it is not a question of copying the past but of drawing inspiration.",1712942239.0,AskMiddleEast

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me. 

If you have any questions please ask me before assuming… but I just can’t sit here and not share this when they wish for me to share what I can with the world…. ",1712825135.0,AskMiddleEast

Why didn't secularism take off in the Arab World the way that it did in Turkey?,0,1c09cxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c09cxo/why_didnt_secularism_take_off_in_the_arab_world/,7,1712712536.0," Kemal Ataturk was a devout Muslim, but was a staunch believer of separating religion and state affairs and was implementing stuff similar to the *Laicite* in France today. There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Hi everyone! I created my very first video yesterday. My goal is to document all war crimes committed against the Palestinians before the 7 October attack. I believe that people across the world need to know more how Israel “blatantly violated international laws” and why there is no accountability for their genocidal crimes. 

What do you think?

We see in the West a rapid death of Christianity. Having lived in France, Germany and England, I can tell you that among Europeans of Christian origin, religion is considered a relic of the past.  I remember when I was in middle school, the kids were shocked that I was truly a believer.  Will Islamic civilization take the same path as the West?  I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested. Any hot-headed defending of Harry will scream monarchy fetishism without analyzing the quality of skill and if it's getting people killed (their skill is extremely low, their strategy is extremely parasitic, and yes, it is getting people killed) and won't be considered.",1712413424.0,AskMiddleEast

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,72,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,26,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

Seriously, why all this hostility? Liberalism is about freedom and equality. Free speech, free press, freedom of religion and equality between everyone including Muslims and non-Muslims. Liberal values are the reason why many Muslims practice their religion in many non-Muslim countries. Are we going to demand liberal values in other countries but demand sharia in our countries? Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American. 

What TV series would you recommend that might be relatable to an American/Western audience? Could be anything from action to drama to comedy. My personal favorite series is Al-Hayba, but that probably doesn’t portray Lebanon in the most positive light.",1711824236.0,AskMiddleEast

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time.

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,15,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

The situation in Iran was calm, the AD engaged with some quadcopters over isfahan and they managed to shoot them down. 

Iran closed the airspace for an hour, and then they opened it again. 

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal. 

There are some pictures of what appears to be boosters in iraq but that's unclear for now.

I cant find data on how many lebanese have been injured or how much propert has been destroyed or damaged but its definitely more than 0. Would any of this happened if they chose not to attack Israel? Im guessing no. How is their involvement in the Gaza war making Lebanon safer?",1713392002.0,AskMiddleEast

We joke about it saying he’s a coloniser etc for funny stuff but now people are serious. They have started to distance themselves from me. Or say I can go to parties only as long as he isn’t there.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,13,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

A peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict :  Swiss model,19,1c59lwy,https://i.redd.it/nxdlqaw3hsuc1.jpeg,9,1713250419.0,"  I thought that the resolution of the conflict goes through several obligatory stages: -The return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1947. This is an absolute requirement to put an end to the feeling of injustice, colonialism and ethnic cleansing.  - Israel must abandon its character of Jewish ethno-nationalism, such a racist vision is outdated and conflicting.  - the Merger of Israel, Gaza, the West Bank into a single state.  The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Were you impressed by the Iranian response or did it leave you with the impression that Iran was too scared to fight a war against the West?  Eg. Zero Israeli casualties in response to the bombing of sovereign Iranian territory that killed an Iranian general

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

Edit: I'm specifically curious what people from the mena region or the diaspora from the region think of the attack.

If you are not of the mena region in some way please pick the results option, as I did.

My friend is pregnant and can't have abortion in her country as it's illegal and she is not married.
She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Please answer with respect this is not a joke, and no I'm not the father I'm just a friend trying to help.",1713152585.0,AskMiddleEast

Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Is there anything about a Sixth Covenant in Arabic/Islamic tradition?,3,1c3pixd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c3pixd/is_there_anything_about_a_sixth_covenant_in/,3,1713086694.0,"Hey all, I've been contributing to this sub and the Palestine sub since Oct-Nov 2023 as an non-Arab foreigner. I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

2024-480=1544 [1 Kings 6:1]  
2024-120(x4)=1544 [Genesis 6:3]

Btw here's my friend's prediction for if the US enters into conflict with Iran (and if the red heifers are slain), he and several others saw or dreamt of an event from the skies:

""I saw the West Coast hit by quakes unlike any other and there was a roaring sound in the sky during it, the atmosphere became as if heavy like a great weight was put on top of everything.

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.  Ps: I know that this system could have existed in the Ottoman or Mughal empire, it is not a question of copying the past but of drawing inspiration.",1712942239.0,AskMiddleEast

[https://archive.ph/DkYat](https://archive.ph/DkYat)

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me. 

If you have any questions please ask me before assuming… but I just can’t sit here and not share this when they wish for me to share what I can with the world…. ",1712825135.0,AskMiddleEast

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas !

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

I would love to know even the smallest basic etiquette, both cultural and non cultural, that I should have when going to the wedding, what's expected of me, and what do I bring. I know I have to bring flowers, but how many? Do I get some for her whole family? Do I need to say something in particular to her parents? Her mom? Her family members? What kind of mannerisms should I exhibit? Any kind of dance moves I should learn outside of Dabke? Every little etiquette you can think of, I would love to know.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

If they were really serious about it they wouldn't say openly they're gonna smuggle weapons to Jordan because now the monarchic regime will just send more police and army to the Syria and Iraq borders to prevent it from happening.

I'm not saying the Islamic Resistance in Iraq is bad in general because of that though, I support their armed actions against American bases in Iraq and Syria and against Isn'treal

Is secularism the solution,22,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Seriously, why all this hostility? Liberalism is about freedom and equality. Free speech, free press, freedom of religion and equality between everyone including Muslims and non-Muslims. Liberal values are the reason why many Muslims practice their religion in many non-Muslim countries. Are we going to demand liberal values in other countries but demand sharia in our countries? Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time.

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,12,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal.

i asked myself this question forever really. so if you see arabs or turks nowadays and on historical fotographs youll notice that the most common fashion to wear the beard is with everything shaved except for the moustache, which is kept well groomed.
now the middle east was greatly influenced by islam throughout their history, so how did this fashion develop? this is the exact opposite of what muslim men are taught to have. i kind of get it in türkiye where you had atatürk and so on, but the arab nations? does anyone know where this fashion came from and why it is/ was so popular, despite opposing islam so directly?

-English native speaker, pretty weak with other languages (French is poor; MSA going slowly, spoken Arabic or any other local language will also be slow-going because I'm not great at learning things ""by ear""). 

-I'm seeking further education so I'd probably try to enroll in a local university for Master's or a post-grad diploma.

However, ever since the attack people have been taking go’s at me for being friends with him. I like his character and he’s a brother to me. I overlooked his Israeli heritage.

We joke about it saying he’s a coloniser etc for funny stuff but now people are serious. They have started to distance themselves from me. Or say I can go to parties only as long as he isn’t there. 

Really hurts but I’m also conflicted slightly because he does support his country afterall.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,15,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

She is Egyptian and currently in Egypt, she tried the pills for abortion and ended up in the ER and didn't work and now she is in the third month of pregnancy.

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Iran’s attack seemed planned to minimize casualties while maximizing spectacle | CNN,18,1c3wvuj,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/14/middleeast/iran-israel-attack-drones-analysis-intl/index.html,17,1713110395.0,"""The style of attack is reminiscent of Tehran’s response to former President Donald Trump’s targeted killing of Iran’s most storied general, Qassem Soleimani, in January 2020. Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

Do you think this shows Iranian strength?

Do you think this will deter Israeli escalation?

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture. They are an important part of this region and make up a significant portion of the population.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

Unpopular opinion : The Mullahs of Iran should just swallow their pride and not disrupt the tempo.

Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

&#x200B;

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

&#x200B;

Western governments have always believed that the security of their colonial project in the middle east is only granted through instating obedient dictators and monarchs who know very well that Israel's security is a priority and are ready to suppress their people to oblivion to achieve this goal.

Deal with religious plurality in MENA,0,1c2eqr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c2eqr1/deal_with_religious_plurality_in_mena/,5,1712942239.0,"I think that the problem of the place of religion in the Middle East requires a middle ground solution.  Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.  Ps: I know that this system could have existed in the Ottoman or Mughal empire, it is not a question of copying the past but of drawing inspiration.",1712942239.0,AskMiddleEast

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

The doctrine of Hamas regarding the long standing conflict,3,1bzb5k5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzb5k5/the_doctrine_of_hamas_regarding_the_long_standing/,11,1712614328.0,"I hear today Hamas's (or maybe Hamas supporters IDK) response to the ceasefire proposed by the US and Israel . I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas ! I feel like they are becoming an establishment with the resistance as a finality not a mean to achieve statehood, just like PLO became after Arafat.   
Do you feel the same ?

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,25,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

How flawed hamas in your opinion,0,1bt9fwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bt9fwe/how_flawed_hamas_in_your_opinion/,5,1711991553.0,"I did used to ask this quite long ago ( well more like i used to ask how did some of you view hamas ) but the respond seems lacking. So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

About 80 percent of the population of the island are Greek cypriots. After an attempted coup in Nicosia Turkey invaded the north of the country to safeguard the status quo, but they still occupy north Cyprus, and have moved settlers from Anatolia to the north. I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American. 

What TV series would you recommend that might be relatable to an American/Western audience? Could be anything from action to drama to comedy. My personal favorite series is Al-Hayba, but that probably doesn’t portray Lebanon in the most positive light.",1711824236.0,AskMiddleEast

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time.

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,11,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

The situation in Iran was calm, the AD engaged with some quadcopters over isfahan and they managed to shoot them down. 

Iran closed the airspace for an hour, and then they opened it again. 

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all. 

Israel has not taken responsibility for whatever this was and everything is back to normal.

Now if Hezbollah just had a bunch of weapons and used them against israeli planes or soldiers that crossed into Lebanese territory, I would buy that, but their recent conflict against Israel was started by them, with the purpose of helping their allies in Gaza according to them.

So how does this protect Lebanon? Almost 600 lebanese people have died so far, about 60 of them civilians. 100k lebanese have been displaced. I cant find data on how many lebanese have been injured or how much propert has been destroyed or damaged but its definitely more than 0.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,12,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)

A peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict :  Swiss model,17,1c59lwy,https://i.redd.it/nxdlqaw3hsuc1.jpeg,9,1713250419.0,"  I thought that the resolution of the conflict goes through several obligatory stages: -The return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1947. This is an absolute requirement to put an end to the feeling of injustice, colonialism and ethnic cleansing.  - Israel must abandon its character of Jewish ethno-nationalism, such a racist vision is outdated and conflicting.  - the Merger of Israel, Gaza, the West Bank into a single state.  The newly created country must be ultra-decentralized, following the Swiss model, with mini cantons with very, very great autonomy.  Thus, cantons could have a majority of secular Jews, Orthodox Jews, Haredim, Sunni Arabs, Druze, Christian Arabs, etc.  This decentralization will have one exception, the common army which will be a union of Arab, Jewish, European soldiers guaranteeing peace, the closing of historical wounds.  -extremists, whether Zionists or ultra-Islamists, will obviously have to be banned or expelled from the country",1713250419.0,AskMiddleEast

Statement issued by the Islamic Resistance:

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

""Permission \[to fight\] has been given to those who are being fought because they were wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory."" (Quran 22:39)

In support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and in solidarity with their brave and honorable resistance, and after closely monitoring and anticipating the movements of the enemy forces, the Islamic Resistance fighters planted a number of explosive devices in the area of Tal Ismail, adjacent to the border with occupied Palestine within the Lebanese territory. When a unit belonging to the Golani Brigade crossed the border and reached the location of the explosive devices, they were detonated, resulting in casualties among their ranks, leaving them dead and wounded.

""And victory is not but from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.""

Monday, April 15, 2024

=============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" media: Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for detonating the explosive devices by ""Israeli"" forces near the border with Lebanon. The ""Israeli"" army is still investigating the incident.

==============

\#Enemy\_Media

""Israeli"" Occupation Army Radio: Under the headline 'Permitted for Publication': The explosion targeting Golani unit soldiers occurred inside Lebanese territory after ""Israeli"" forces attempted to operate tens of meters away from the border fence.

============

English: Ali Shoaib:

The achievement of the resistance by detonating IEDs with an infiltrated Israeli force outside the border in the town of dahira is as follows :

\- Accurate day and night follow-up in a forested area relatively far from homes, in a harsh war atmosphere due to the limited geography of movement .

\- The ability to determine the path that the infiltrating force will take

\- Luring the enemy to the same path by not intercepting the first move while staying on the follow-up, it is certain that the target force has previously entered under the gaze of the Resisters

\- Reaching an area adjacent to the border and planting explosive devices on the track under the continuous flight of drones, artillery shelling and airstrikes

\- Waiting for the infiltrating force and detonating the canisters",1713184716.0,AskMiddleEast

Edit: personally I thought Iran would have been fully justified to murder an Israeli general in retaliation for the murder of an Iranian general and their entourage.

On the one hand I appreciate that Iran didn't escalate the situation but if I'm being truthful I found their response weak.

I would be seething in anger if that Iranian general or one of his entourage was my family member, and I saw the response was only some runways that were destroyed. (I imagine a runway is not that hard to repair)

We are thinking about getting her on a visit visa to look for work here in dubai and give birth unmarried, the questions are:

Is it legal for an Arab Muslim lady to give birth unmarried and declare the father unknown? 

If she didn't find a job before birth time can she extend the visa or go to Oman then return on a new visit visa and still give birth same situation but without an Emirates ID?

We know 99% percent she will pay the whole thing out of pocket so how much is the average cost for following up and scans and giving birth in a relatively not expensive clinic? 

Are there any other things to consider in this situation or better solutions?

Tehran gave US troops 10 hours of advance warning before raining down massive ballistic missiles on US military positions in Iraq, including al-Asad airbase. The attack wreaked havoc, leaving gaping craters in the ground, but caused no known US casualties. In the process, Iranian forces accidentally shot down a commercial jet taking off from Tehran airport, killing over 100 passengers and fuelling public anger against a regime increasingly seen as incompetent.

At the time, the Iranians were preoccupied with demonstrating what their military could do, rather than what it was willing to do. The US did not retaliate, averting regional war.

Four years later, Iran’s playbook may not unfold in the same way. Israel has already vowed to respond. The US has publicly stated it would not participate in an Israeli retaliation, which may reassure Iran. Yet Netanyahu’s Israel has proven increasingly unpredictable. Iran’s threats of more severe action in case of further escalation may fall on deaf ears in Israel, to its own peril.""


What are your opinions about Iran's counter-attack to Israel?

It seems they launch the attack from Iran and gave Israel about 10 hours of warning to prepare to intercept the drones and missiles.

It seems like an attack designed to minimize Israeli casualties while still allowing the Iranian government to claim that it fought back and didn't just accept the murder of its general.

And I must say, good on Oman for not participating in the land route to Israel. Huge respect tbf.

At this point, not that it'd be surprising, an Israeli escelation will be simply one more step toward economic suicide. Iranian-produced weaponry is rather cheap compared to what Israel pays to intercept them.

I have no pathetic apologies to issue, just that I've been spending the past few years trying to do what my fellow Americans ought to be doing.

My seer friend MrMars claims that there have been five broken covenants, with the 6th one being broken by the Zionists, in their attempts to usher in Dajjal, they're violating a covenant with their ancestral deity. He says the western Christians are assisting them and ""decided to combine forces"" on the 12th (since when?) while the Muslims are taking the bait and falling for a trap.

I assume he was referring to **Malachi 2:8-10**. My question is: Are there any supporting facts for **multiple covenant violations** in Arabic traditions, legends, myths? Not just Islam.

I've been running some searches, trying to find some corroboration for it in Islam. There are over 150 mentions for ""covenant"" in hadiths, and over 300 in the Quran. I simply don't have the time to go through all of them.  So far, the search results inform me that those who violate their treaties, break their oaths and pledges will suffer the worst fate of all men. Mohammed was encouraged to fight their leaders to deter some of their followers.
___

MrM says America has 40 days (idk where he gets this duration from, Noah or Jonah?) to repent and to refrain from assisting Israel in their error. The given deadline is **May 18, 2024**, he didn't say what would happen after that, but it does coincide with Putin's meeting with Xi in the latter half of May.

Also, is there anything significant about year **1544** in Islamic history? Could just be a coincidence.

2024-480=1544 [1 Kings 6:1]  
2024-120(x4)=1544 [Genesis 6:3]

How would the liberation of Palestine be possible from a military scenario?,0,1c31u3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c31u3w/how_would_the_liberation_of_palestine_be_possible/,46,1713014483.0,"In my opinion, Turkey is the only country that could reasonably attack Israel and not come out on the losing end of it. They are a member of NATO so the US would be put in an absolute diplomatic bind. Israel would be put in a situation where if they nuked Turkey, the US would be bound to come to Turkey's defense and attack Israel, so Israel really couldn't get away with doing anything over the top. Turkey has the military might and also has the political will, from their people, and Erdogan's recent election losses would give him the incentive to get the people back on their side.

So while Iran is making their retaliatory strike, Heszbollah and Syria could surround the Golan Heights. Israel has no moral high ground here. This is Syrian territory by international law, this is just Syria defending itself with the help of Hezbollah. Syria takes back the Golan Heights now Israel is completely focused there. Meanwhile Turkey launches an assault on Israeli military targets. The Houthis go in full force to distract the US in the Mediterranean. 

Now Israel has to deal with Turkey, Syria and Hezbollah. Meanwhile Egypt moves into Gaza, not specifically to attack Israel, but to protect it's borders and provide security at the invitation of the Palestinian Authority. Jordan does the same in the West Bank. Both these countries have peace agreements with Israel, neither are invading Israeli territory, if Israel attacks them, they are the ones breaking the peace agreement.

So Egypt is in Gaza to help the Palestinian Authority regain control. Jordan does the same in the West Bank and Syria Regains the Golan Heights. Israel is forced to either rescind claims to these territories or continue fighting Turkey. If they refuse, they are faced with a full occupation by Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, all US allies that would be difficult to justify going to war with.

I think this is one of the most realistic scenarios to liberate Palestine without risking nuclear war from Israel, since Netanyahu seems like a madman, but it would be extremely difficult to justify using nukes in this scenario.

What do you think? Is this realistic? Do you have a better scenario to liberate Palestine?

On every post that even mentions Morocco the entire comment section is flooded with people insisting that Moroccans are not Arabs. I even saw someone saying that Darija is Tamazight mixed with French and has nothing to do with Arabic, which is a ridiculous thing to say and yet that comment had hundreds of likes. Even funnier, a lot of these types of people don't know anything about Amazigh culture or languages. 
There are Amazigh people in Morocco, and it's true most of us have berber ancestry, but like half if not most moroccans irl identify as arab. Generalizing the entirety of the population as this or that and denying people their identity is very weird imo.
Egyptians and lebanese people are also like this.

It seems that the Arab identity is just not popular anymore. People want to stay tf away from that word as far as possible.

So why is that and when did this trend start?

EDIT: To clear a misunderstanding: There ARE Amazighs in Morocco and the rest of North Africa, they speak Tamazight languages and have their unique culture.

Israeli Allies: 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇮🇳 with support from NATO

Palestinian Allies: 🇹🇷🇶🇦🇮🇷🇾🇪🇱🇧🇨🇳🇷🇺

Neutral: 🇸🇦🇦🇪🇪🇬🇯🇴🇸🇾🇮🇶🇲🇾🇮🇩🇯🇵🇰🇷🇲🇦

Within first 48hrs:

Israel decides to strike first and attack key strategic Hezbollah sites using Israeli and American airforce 

The US sets up its Navy in Mediterranean Sea, in anticipation of Iranian retaliation. The theatre of war now becomes split; with the Lebanon theatre opening up, and the continuing of Palestine/Gaza.

Israeli and American jets refuel on Naval ships and land bases and continue air operations, wave after wave on “Hezbollah targets” only.

Neutral countries remain neutral either in truth or on the surface, intentions/actions unknown 

Iran has no choice but to directly attack Israeli sites and send its military to the Lebanese borders to protect Hezbollah Assets, and mobile militia through Syria and Iraq. 

The US bases within Iraq and Syria skirmish with Iranian militia trying to reach Israel and Lebanon. This slows down the militia and Iran sends its military into this region also.

Russia is a close Ally of Iran, and is brought into the war, on a limited front to protect Iran. Its focus is to try and de-escalate, but is willing to use force if necessary against Israel but not USA.

NATO allies conduct bombing raids within Syrian and Iraq territories. NATO warns Syrian and Iraq government to not mobilise against them as they’re only targeting Iranian militia.

China is on red alert and moves its Naval fleet and mobilises forward operating bases. China is very close with Russia and Iran, and is dependant on Russian oil and resources coming from the Iranian region, so it must secure these pipelines.

India conducts cyber warfare on Iranian sites in coordination with Israeli cyber teams.

Israel conducts specific air strikes on Iranian sites including nuclear sites. Iran retaliates with the same strikes within Israel but not to the same effect due to superior defence systems and US/NATO interception.

Houthi fighters are in an all out war down south in the Red Sea theatre with NATO as NATO tries to enter through there and support Israel. 


What would happen post 48 hours:

Under growing pressure from the Turkish population, Turkey enters the war in a bid to suppress Israeli aggression and end the war where in which they’re favourable. Turkey sets up a staging post in Cyprus and exercises its maritime borders to push back Any NATO ships away from Its borders.

As Turkey is a NATO country, this creates instability with the organisation and Russia and Qatar backs Turkey.

Saudi Arabia and the gulf countries condemn Qatars financial and political support to Hamas and Turkey

Saudi Arabia no longer is neutral and works in cooperation with NATO, but “not Israel” to curb Iranian militia in Iraq.

Ironically they are the same voices that had been accusing khamas of ""empty slogans"" before October 7th. Then switched to ""luxurious hotels in Qatar while the people are dying"" after October 7th. And now after Haniyeh's sons' death they have lost the plot. But give them 2 weeks and they will come back from a different angle regardless.

Iran shouldn't escalate for ""ego"" reasons cuz it will be blamed for ""not doing enough"" nonetheless. It should only escalate if there is strategic advantage. I understand we aren't best pals with the mullahs of Iran mainly because of their crimes in Syria and also their internal politics. But looking back on the situation in Syria one can't help but notice how things could have been drastically different had the neighboring Arab countries been actually ruled by leaders who reflected the people's interests not puppets only following orders. Dictatorships and monarchs who did nothing to actually support the Syrian people and solidify their stance. They just watched it all as the orders came from their masters to smuggle random fighters to complicate the situation even more and serve certain agendas.

Liberal secularism is not adapted to 90% of this region, westernized secular elites tend to leave or have very few children.  We must find a political model more suited to Islamic civilization and which will satisfy as many people as possible.  Already, it seems that even liberalism is based on beliefs and conviction, it is not neutral, it places the individual above the community, and places the varieties of values ​​in societies at the same level except for freedom which would be higher  to all values, it is already a bias that some liberal thinkers accept and that others refuse (claiming themselves to be neutral).  Already, we cannot deny that nationalism itself is in tension with liberalism, because it sometimes violently imposes a nation state which makes a language, the drawing of borders, an identity obligatory.  Thus the modern nation state claims neutrality in the religious world but is not neutral but imposes a common identity.  A form of coercion is therefore considered acceptable.  The Muslim world should build countries differently, instead of the dogma of the secular nation state, it should promote more decentralization allowing different segments of society the possibility of voting for laws specific to their regions.  A region of the state that is 98% conservative Muslims should be able to organize itself differently from an ultra-urban region with a lot of religious diversity.  This model seems to exist in Indonesia.  It can largely be improved.  There still remains the problem of changing religion, in my opinion of course it must be recognized and protected everywhere, but apostates in conservative Muslim regions will have to accept the rules of Muslim modesty, the absence of blasphemy etc, or choose to migrate  towards a more liberal city (which is already happening everywhere in the world).  Obviously the main concerns for this system are that it would reduce national identity (the doctrine of the nation state tends to homogenize the country in terms of values ​​and culture, to make religion secondary, etc.) and the risk that certain  extremists take advantage of it.  I find this proposal interesting because many countries are decentralized to adapt to ethno-linguistic diversity (and that is a very good thing) but few for fundamental and confessional values.  Ps: I know that this system could have existed in the Ottoman or Mughal empire, it is not a question of copying the past but of drawing inspiration.",1712942239.0,AskMiddleEast

Netanyahu dealt Israel a terrible blow

My conclusion from October 7 as a journalist is that what's ""uncomfortable"" is the most dangerous thing for our security and our future here, that being addicted to feeling good is itself what's dangerous. We need to tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it hurts, even if some people deplore it, even if it lowers morale.

We need to stand up to the Bibi-ist propaganda machines even if attack dogs are sniffing at our crotch. If on October 1, someone had said that the chief of military intelligence was incompetent, that military intelligence could plan successful operations but was incapable of providing a warning about a coming war, that the Shin Bet was dozing and that we were about to get the whooping of our lives, such a person would have been perceived as crazy, defeatist and out of touch. Certain politicians would have called for such a person to be charged with spreading false news. There were so many signs that the military was in bad shape, but we wouldn't see them – because we believe things are all right.

It's unpleasant to say, but we may not be able to safety return to Israel's northern border, to what had been before. Hezbollah has changed that equation, to its own benefit. That's the situation.

We constantly tell ourselves about an imaginary deadline – April, May, September 1 – and if Hezbollah keeps it up until then, we'll give it a thorough shellacking. The deadline keeps being pushed back. The border region remains empty. The deceit continues. There now seems to be a high probability that for years, anyone driving along the border will be a target. Tel Hai will fall again.

And that's true on every front: Not all hostages will return, either alive or dead. The whereabouts of some are lost, and their fate will remain unknown. They'll be like the downed airforce navigator Ron Arad. Their relatives will go around sick with worry, fear and apprehension. From time to time, we'll launch balloons in their memory.

No cabinet minister will restore our sense of personal security. Every Iranian threat will make us tremble. Our international standing was dealt a beating. Our leadership's weakness was revealed to the outside. For years we managed to fool them into thinking we were a strong country, a wise people and a powerful army. In truth, we're a shtetl with an air force, and that's on the condition that its awakened in time.

In part it's the military's sacred place in Israel that makes it so hard to admit defeat. You can't say anything bad about the military. Only when it comes to October 7 are you specifically allowed to talk about a disgrace. Since then, we've been lions.

Granted that many combat soldiers are indeed lions. They got up and left home. They fought, demonstrated skill as soldiers and chalked up impressive tactical achievements. Our defeat doesn't mean they're not good soldiers, that they didn't make an effort, that they didn't deliver or risk their lives, that they weren't prepared to do whatever was required. It means that the combination of military capabilities and the politicians' conduct produced an unfavorable outcome. The spin doctors keep jumping up yelling that ""you're hurting soldiers' morale."" In truth, that's easy to put across because who wants to come out in opposition to the soldiers?

So we keep fooling ourselves.

Along with natural psychology, there are the machines plying lies and deceit. There's a political camp the very survival of which pretty much depends on a ""victory."" That camp has long since lost all touch with truth and reality. We've gotten to know its leader, that human Pinocchio. For months, he's been talking of ""total victory"" and of being ""a step away from victory."" And for a couple of months, he's been saying that we're going to enter Rafah ""right away,"" tomorrow, tomorrow, here I go. I would believe TV reality figure Ohad Buzaglo telling me I'm his one true love before I would believe one word from Netanyahu.

The system is to procrastinate for as long as possible, and in the meantime – lie. The army of spokespeople is hollering. And in recent months, right-wing Channel 14 has been giving rise to a new mouthpiece, a ""shababnik,"" as the ultra-Orthodox community calls people on the community's margins, by the name of Motty Castel. If Yinon Magal and Erel Segal are submissive slaves to the father-king, Castel is a serf to the king's son Yair Netanyahu. I've seen freer people at the Dungeon club.

This week Castel broke through Channel 14 screens to promise the people that victory is at hand: ""I'm being contacted by a lot of citizens \[who ask\]: 'Have we given up on Rafah?' I'm saying with all due responsibility that we will enter Rafah. The prime minister has said too many times himself that we will enter Rafah and he can't forgo entering Rafah. Furthermore, he also said in one interview that we're going to have to do it on our own, contrary to the position of the United States. We will do it. You can calm down. It will happen.""

Rafah is the newest bluff that the mouthpieces are plying to fool us and make us think that victory is just moments away. By the time they enter Rafah, the actual event will have lost its significance. There may be an incursion, perhaps a tiny one, sometime – say in May. After that, they'll peddle the next lie, that all we have to do is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank), and victory will be on its way. The reality is that the war's aims will not be achieved. Hamas will not be eradicated. The hostages will not be returned through military pressure. Security will not be reestablished.

The more the mouthpieces shout that ""we're winning,"" the clearer it is that we're losing. Lying is their craft. We need to get used to that. Life is less secure than before October 7. The beating we took will sting for years to come. The international ostracism won't go away. And, of course, the dead won't be coming back. Nor will many of the hostages.

For some of us, life will get back on track, with the petrifying fear of an imminent repeat. And for some of us, life won't get back on track. Those people will walk among us like the living dead. That's what we voted for. That's how it is. We need to get used to the sad reality in our homeland.

My question is in the title but if you want some background: 

I am American and I found a Syrian man on TikTok a month or so back, he has an American friend who interpreted for him. She explained why he was there and what was happening. At first I thought it was a scam or something and so I did what I do and just… wanted to ask them myself so I added Syrians on WhatsApp and I learned a lot. I learned so much and made many close close friends in Syria and Palestine that I can no longer avert my eyes. 

Since then I have spoken to many many people across the Middle East and I made a very close friend with a Syrian refugee among many other close friends, this man and I have formed a brotherhood bond I can’t even explain. We cried together when we got to speak with a live interpreter for the first time… I am just some Mexican American who wanted to learn and lend an ear to these issues. Now here is where my main question is.

They have all shared with me videos of the conflict and it has so much truth to it. Everywhere I go except YouTube is very pro Assad and I am only looking to share what I was given which in my opinion is the truth, the regime is evil and killing innocents. My brothers and sisters in Syria want me to post videos in which it doesn’t disclose any identities, just shows first hand accounts of the horrors the civilians who just want peace and freedom face. 

Straight up I am tired of the propaganda I see on Twitter and I wish to be a journalist on somewhere like YouTube or Twitter where I can responsibly and safely show the world what I have seen. 

There is so much more to this that I can’t explain over a reddit post but I am very very willing to risk jail if it means even just some support Syria doesn’t get from us. I want to share with the world what the voiceless have shared with me. 

If you have any questions please ask me before assuming… but I just can’t sit here and not share this when they wish for me to share what I can with the world…. ",1712825135.0,AskMiddleEast

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

Is the online campaign that Sweden kidnaps muslim children prevalent in the Middle East?,0,1bvvn16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bvvn16/is_the_online_campaign_that_sweden_kidnaps_muslim/,5,1712257451.0,"So what basically has happened is that a few immigrant families had their children removed by the social services, because they either slap their children, which is super illegal here, even a small slap on their bottom can get you jailed, pulling their children from school, which is also super illegal here, and such. 

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Last I heard, they were trying to spread this message around to a Middle-eastern channels, to spread the word.

Have you seen this campaign in any middle eastern channel? How prevalent in this campaign?",1712257451.0,AskMiddleEast

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Who do you think developed numerals? Was it a joint effort by Hindus from India and Arabs, a pure Hindu invention or an invention of the Islamic Golden Age?",1712131107.0,AskMiddleEast

Is secularism the solution,24,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,106,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ​​the nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian.

Seriously, why all this hostility? Liberalism is about freedom and equality. Free speech, free press, freedom of religion and equality between everyone including Muslims and non-Muslims. Liberal values are the reason why many Muslims practice their religion in many non-Muslim countries. Are we going to demand liberal values in other countries but demand sharia in our countries? Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they’re terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that’s different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

And I’m definitely happy seeing Iran retaliate against Israel. However to me it seems because Iran has sent missiles to Israel, everyone is now praising their regime and the IR simply for taking some action towards Israel. Seems like they forgot about the hundreds of thousands they’ve killed and the countries the IR destabilized in the Middle East. It’s like the few missiles that hit Israel are worth the hundreds of thousands of innocent lives lost in the region that they’ve caused directly or indirectly and honestly it’s just sick imo. While it’s good that they retaliated, human lives aren’t that cheap where a few missiles can repay for them. The Palestinian cause while crucially important shouldn’t be at the expense of the people of Iran Lebanon Syria Iraq Yemen etc. 

It’s just like my post a while back about those forgetting and denying about the Uyghur genocide simply because china supports Palestine in name. And remember the IR don’t even retaliate until their embassy was destroyed. It wasn’t done for the sake of the Palestinians. I swear people will support anyone be it Bashar Al Assad or Mao Zedong as long as they claim to be against Israel. As if two things can’t be true at the same time. 

Remember don’t be fooled, just because Iran retaliated doesn’t make the IR good. We need to think with logic, not emotion if we’re to have success in this ummah. ",1713764397.0,AskMiddleEast

In Egypt when people refer to boycotted products they just use it as a blanket statement to target any Western owned company. I'm not against it's just an observation. I also like how we just refer to products as ""mo2at3a"" I think that probably contributes to creating an almost taboo culture around drinking pepsi or eating McDonalds now.

I'm not sure seeing videos and pictures of dead Palestinians is that significant because we still saw similar pictures circulating years ago and people would boycott then drop really quickly.

  
edit: it’s really ironic how after (what feels like) our government opening McDonalds left and right we end up boycotting them.",1713653313.0,AskMiddleEast

TURKISH ANTI-ARAB SENTIMENT,13,1c7ymtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c7ymtl/turkish_antiarab_sentiment/,77,1713537848.0,"- Speaking according to my experience of 6 years of living in Turkey. Not propaganda as many will claim.

Anti-arab sentiment among Turkish nationalists is hugely unjustifiable, delusional, and misguiding.

What's even worse is they don't lie about the history, but still blame and hate on the Arabs.

Their main argument is that the Arabs have 'betrayed' the Ottomans by becoming nationalistic, and allying with the British to kick them out of Arab land.

They tend to ignore the facts that they don't even deny.

1. Turks started to adopt nationalism, which reached its height during the last few decades of the Ottoman empire, before the Arabs. Most notably trying to force the populations of northern Iraq and Levant to speak Turkish and actually become 'Turkish', a policy Arabic historians call 'Turkification/التتريك), and the rise of Turkish Youth (Jon Türkler) and their discrimination against the Arabs. But as soon as the Arabs became nationalist, they act betrayed. For them, Turks have the right to be nationalist, but Arabs do not. 

2. They themselves are alligned with the parties that fought against the Ottoman caliphate, most notably of course Atatürk. But they think Arabs betrayed them for fighting against the Ottomans.

3. The Ottoman empire only provided relative peace. Overwhelming majority of the region's resources were used for Anatolia, leaving the Arab Ottoman territories far behind in development. Yet they are upset the Arab people revolted for their rights.

...these and many more contradictions and unjustifiable hate that I have seen in nationalist Turks, who hates Arabs for that history and for their inelianable right to fight for their rights, while they are part of NATO and sold parts of Turkish land to the US, and aided in the invasion of Iraq, and taking part in Syria's civil war, and aiding Israel by sending goods and weaponry.

Turkish nationalism is a soft-core Zionist ideology where they still, until today, try to turkify the Kurds and prosecute them, making the Kurdish language illegal, and keep on denying the Armenian Genocide.

If it weren't for Israel, nationalist Turks would have been the most hated demographic of the region.

The only footage online is an AD Canon firing at something in low atitude near the Iranian air force base in isfahan. 

The air base has not suffered any damages and there are live reports from inside it. 

Iran said few Quadcopters were launched from inside the country and that's all.

i asked myself this question forever really. so if you see arabs or turks nowadays and on historical fotographs youll notice that the most common fashion to wear the beard is with everything shaved except for the moustache, which is kept well groomed.
now the middle east was greatly influenced by islam throughout their history, so how did this fashion develop? this is the exact opposite of what muslim men are taught to have. i kind of get it in türkiye where you had atatürk and so on, but the arab nations? does anyone know where this fashion came from and why it is/ was so popular, despite opposing islam so directly?

-I'm seeking further education so I'd probably try to enroll in a local university for Master's or a post-grad diploma.

He’s a selfless person who puts others kindness before his. Even the small things like making me lunch after we go university. We play football together as well.

However, ever since the attack people have been taking go’s at me for being friends with him. I like his character and he’s a brother to me. I overlooked his Israeli heritage.

We joke about it saying he’s a coloniser etc for funny stuff but now people are serious. They have started to distance themselves from me. Or say I can go to parties only as long as he isn’t there. 

Really hurts but I’m also conflicted slightly because he does support his country afterall.

What is the economical situation in Jordan? Why can't it develop?,14,1c5jyze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c5jyze/what_is_the_economical_situation_in_jordan_why/,4,1713283774.0,"Hi, 

so, i'm not from the region, but i'm very interested in Jordan after the recent events. 

People are talking about the current situation in Jordan, how someone should overthrow the king etc. 

But honestly, what would you have then?

A ""palestine-friendly"" country which would pay the price of a starving population and political crisis. How exactly would that help anyone?

Isn't it more important to have a country that has some leverage in the first place?

This brings me to the question i want to ask. 

The text i wrote at the beginning of my post is based on the assumption that the jordanian people aren't starving already. How is the economical situation in your country? The available data says that your GDP p.c. is about 4,000 dollars, which is OK-ish in world standards. 

But what are your average wages in reality? Is there work? How big is the divide between rich and poor?

A look on Jordan's statistics says that the country's economy is not developing at all since at least 16 years (800 dollars in that period, meaning an average GDP growth of about 1-1,5%, e.g. nothing for a developing economy). 

What is holding you back? Are there factors in society, political instability etc. which are problematic? From the outside, you do seem to have everything needed for a stable society: Religous homogenous, a stable government (it may not represent all the people, but its stable), no direct political conflicts with any of your neigbors. 

What hinders you? Isn't it possible to gain investment from GCC countries who are very keen to find new investment oppurtunities? To strengthen the education of your people? Or is there any outer factor which you seem to be holding you back deliberately?

I hope you might get me some insight :)
