Doubts on Assad responsibility for use of sarin gas in Ghouta?,2,183tv85,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/183tv85/doubts_on_assad_responsibility_for_use_of_sarin/,3,1700947267.0,"Hello everyone,

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

He succeeded in killing 9 murtaddin and in injuring 12 others, and the operation was followed by fierce clashes that resulted in 24 murtaddin being killed and a number of others being wounded.

>Meanwhile, a number of Islamic State soldiers carried out an assault on Nusayri positions south of the village of Ghanim al-‘Ali located towards the southeast of the wilayah. Fierce clashes took place and lasted for several hours, leading to 11 murtaddin being killed. A number of mujahidin then remained and lured the murtaddin into returning to the same location. They then clashed with them using light and medium weapons, and succeeded in killing 7 of them and in capturing another three before returning safely back to their positions.

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Why Syria is facing a situation like India where there is a dearth of oxygen?,5,n43nyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/n43nyl/why_syria_is_facing_a_situation_like_india_where/,0,1620066932.0,"The major problem is that 90 percent of the country is living in poverty.

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

I want to share this intriguing news I have read today. It’s all about a girl from Britain who was trafficked to Islamic State territory in Syria and then raped and impregnated by her jihadi ‘husband’ is among former UK nationals stranded in a refugee camp. Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

According to reports, Turkey is hammering Kurdish positions near Ain Issa with the first airstrikes in months. It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

***Comment***

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

NightWatch Report: Baghdad rejects KRGs offer & Lebanons PM resigns,5,7b4pjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/7b4pjf/nightwatch_report_baghdad_rejects_krgs_offer/,0,1509969894.0,"#**Iraq**

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

One analyst wrote that Bahrain is a bellwether for the Gulf Cooperation Council in announcing sanctions and travel bans. If so, similar responses are likely from other Gulf countries.",1509969894.0,syrianconflict

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

According to reports, Turkey is hammering Kurdish positions near Ain Issa with the first airstrikes in months. It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

***Comment***

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

"NightWatch Report: The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism, the Syrian talks and Hariri threatens to quit",3,7g476s,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/7g476s/nightwatch_report_the_islamic_military_alliance/,0,1511876477.0,"#**The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism**

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

One analyst wrote that Bahrain is a bellwether for the Gulf Cooperation Council in announcing sanctions and travel bans. If so, similar responses are likely from other Gulf countries.",1509969894.0,syrianconflict

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

***Comment***

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

"NightWatch Report: The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism, the Syrian talks and Hariri threatens to quit",3,7g476s,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/7g476s/nightwatch_report_the_islamic_military_alliance/,0,1511876477.0,"#**The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism**

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

An Istishhadi Operation and Wide Attack on Positions of PKK Murtaddin in Raqqah

>With Allah’s assistance and reliance upon Him, a number of units from the soldiers of the Khilafah launched towards positions of PKK apostates from multiple fighting axes in Raqqah city, where the mujahidin waged fierce confrontations, in conjunction with an istishhadi operation executed by Abu Sulayman al-Jaza’iri (may Allah accept him), hitting positions of the apostates on the edges of ar-Rumaniyyah village in the west of the city. The confrontations are still ongoing amidst a siege on some remnants of the apostates in several sites. We ask Allah to grant conquest at the hands of His worshipers. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of creation.

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

Doubts on Assad responsibility for use of sarin gas in Ghouta?,2,183tv85,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/183tv85/doubts_on_assad_responsibility_for_use_of_sarin/,3,1700947267.0,"Hello everyone,

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

He succeeded in killing 9 murtaddin and in injuring 12 others, and the operation was followed by fierce clashes that resulted in 24 murtaddin being killed and a number of others being wounded.

>Meanwhile, a number of Islamic State soldiers carried out an assault on Nusayri positions south of the village of Ghanim al-‘Ali located towards the southeast of the wilayah. Fierce clashes took place and lasted for several hours, leading to 11 murtaddin being killed. A number of mujahidin then remained and lured the murtaddin into returning to the same location. They then clashed with them using light and medium weapons, and succeeded in killing 7 of them and in capturing another three before returning safely back to their positions.

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Why Syria is facing a situation like India where there is a dearth of oxygen?,4,n43nyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/n43nyl/why_syria_is_facing_a_situation_like_india_where/,0,1620066932.0,"The major problem is that 90 percent of the country is living in poverty.

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

I want to share this intriguing news I have read today. It’s all about a girl from Britain who was trafficked to Islamic State territory in Syria and then raped and impregnated by her jihadi ‘husband’ is among former UK nationals stranded in a refugee camp. Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

According to reports, Turkey is hammering Kurdish positions near Ain Issa with the first airstrikes in months. It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

***Comment***

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

NightWatch Report: Baghdad rejects KRGs offer & Lebanons PM resigns,4,7b4pjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/7b4pjf/nightwatch_report_baghdad_rejects_krgs_offer/,0,1509969894.0,"#**Iraq**

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

One analyst wrote that Bahrain is a bellwether for the Gulf Cooperation Council in announcing sanctions and travel bans. If so, similar responses are likely from other Gulf countries.",1509969894.0,syrianconflict

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict
"Turkey and Russia, as well as Russian-backed Syrian regime forces, appear to have increased attacks in Syria",1,man0ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/man0ua/turkey_and_russia_as_well_as_russianbacked_syrian/,0,1616418123.0," I want to share this news I read online that in the recent days Turkey and Russia appear to have increased attacks in Syria. According to reports, Turkey is hammering Kurdish positions near Ain Issa with the first airstrikes in months. It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

***Comment***

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

"NightWatch Report: The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism, the Syrian talks and Hariri threatens to quit",3,7g476s,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/7g476s/nightwatch_report_the_islamic_military_alliance/,0,1511876477.0,"#**The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism**

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

One analyst wrote that Bahrain is a bellwether for the Gulf Cooperation Council in announcing sanctions and travel bans. If so, similar responses are likely from other Gulf countries.",1509969894.0,syrianconflict

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

***Comment***

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

"NightWatch Report: The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism, the Syrian talks and Hariri threatens to quit",3,7g476s,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/7g476s/nightwatch_report_the_islamic_military_alliance/,0,1511876477.0,"#**The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism**

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

An Istishhadi Operation and Wide Attack on Positions of PKK Murtaddin in Raqqah

>With Allah’s assistance and reliance upon Him, a number of units from the soldiers of the Khilafah launched towards positions of PKK apostates from multiple fighting axes in Raqqah city, where the mujahidin waged fierce confrontations, in conjunction with an istishhadi operation executed by Abu Sulayman al-Jaza’iri (may Allah accept him), hitting positions of the apostates on the edges of ar-Rumaniyyah village in the west of the city. The confrontations are still ongoing amidst a siege on some remnants of the apostates in several sites. We ask Allah to grant conquest at the hands of His worshipers. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of creation.

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

Doubts on Assad responsibility for use of sarin gas in Ghouta?,2,183tv85,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/183tv85/doubts_on_assad_responsibility_for_use_of_sarin/,3,1700947267.0,"Hello everyone,

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

He succeeded in killing 9 murtaddin and in injuring 12 others, and the operation was followed by fierce clashes that resulted in 24 murtaddin being killed and a number of others being wounded.

>Meanwhile, a number of Islamic State soldiers carried out an assault on Nusayri positions south of the village of Ghanim al-‘Ali located towards the southeast of the wilayah. Fierce clashes took place and lasted for several hours, leading to 11 murtaddin being killed. A number of mujahidin then remained and lured the murtaddin into returning to the same location. They then clashed with them using light and medium weapons, and succeeded in killing 7 of them and in capturing another three before returning safely back to their positions.

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Why Syria is facing a situation like India where there is a dearth of oxygen?,5,n43nyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/n43nyl/why_syria_is_facing_a_situation_like_india_where/,0,1620066932.0,"The major problem is that 90 percent of the country is living in poverty.

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

I want to share this intriguing news I have read today. It’s all about a girl from Britain who was trafficked to Islamic State territory in Syria and then raped and impregnated by her jihadi ‘husband’ is among former UK nationals stranded in a refugee camp. Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict

The recent killing of 13 Turkish hostages captured in a rescue operation by the Kurdistan Workers ' Party has rekindled the fury of Turkey's leader R.Erdogan called for the resumption of operations against the Kurdish formations.

As you know, such a concept as Kurdistan is very relative. It also exists today at the junction of the three countries of the Middle East. These are the northern and eastern parts of Syria, a small part in the south-west of Iraq, as well as southern and eastern Turkey.

The Kurds ' relations with the Republic of Turkey are particularly complex. The neo-Ottoman ambitions of the current leader of Ankara do not let go of the desire to resume the Kurdish genocide. Which year Turkey under the pretext of protecting the borders of its country, as well as the eradication of terrorism on its approaches (Syrian Idlib) Erdogan is simultaneously conducting operations against Kurdish formations. Airstrikes and shelling are being carried out, and groups controlled by Ankara, which today belong to terrorist groups, have also been incited against the Kurds.

However, the life of the people of Kurdistan in the mode of ""constant combat readiness"" forced them to strengthen their positions. The direct support of their chief curator, Washington, also plays a role.

Today, as mentioned earlier, some of the Kurds are also in the Turkish territories. Ankara's goal is to oust these formations from the territories of its country. To do this, the President of Turkey R.Erdogan has developed a plan to oust them.

What is the plan? For the second month, lists of people from the northern part of Syria who want to move to Turkey are being collected. These people are immigrants, as well as active representatives of illegal armed groups that are part of the opposition to the Government forces of the SAR. Erdogan is actively engaged in transporting radicals, while with their families to Turkey, preparing terrorist reinforcements under his control, which should later completely oust the Kurds from the country.

In his opinion, the Kurdish separatism should be suppressed by members of radical groups, and the armed forces of their country should be protected. Now the leader of Ankara fully uses this opportunity.",1616656648.0,syrianconflict

According to reports, Turkey is hammering Kurdish positions near Ain Issa with the first airstrikes in months. It appears the end goal is mostly to punish Syrians, but not to achieve much else since Turkey, Russia and Iran all work together in Syria. Turkey often seeks to bombard Kurds every time its ruling AK Party wants more votes at home. Usually Turkey claims to be fighting “terrorists” but there is no evidence of any “terrorism” against Turkey from Syria. Turkey generally doesn’t mind if Russia or the Syrian regime kill Syrians in Idlib, just as long as Turkey has free rein to then attack Kurds near Tel Rifat or Ain Issa.

وظهر معظم المسلحين في وسط سوريا بعد ""العفو"" الذي نفذته ما يسمى بالإدارة الذاتية لشمال شرق سوريا الديمقراطية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة.

تمتلئ عصابات داعش المنتشرة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" بالمسلحين  الذين خضعوا لتدريبات خاصة في جنوب وجنوب شرق سوريا في المناطق التي  تحتلها الولايات المتحدة في منطقة التنف ونهر الفرات السوري.

شهد الشهر الماضي ، في ما يسمى بـ ""الصحراء البيضاء"" وسط الجمهورية العربية السورية ، زيادة ملحوظة في نشاط تشكيلات العصابات المكونة من عناصر تنظيم الدولة الإسلامية الإرهابية.

من  خلال تخريب اتصالات النقل وأعمال التخريب في منشآت صناعة النفط والغاز في  سوريا ، من خلال مهاجمة الدوريات ومواقع الجيش السوري ، يعمل المسلحون على  زعزعة استقرار الأوضاع في المنطقة.

من  خلال أفعالهم ، يعرقل الإرهابيون عملية إعادة الإعمار الاجتماعي  والاقتصادي في سوريا وإقامة علاقات بين القبائل العربية المحلية ودمشق. هذا الوضع مفيد في المقام الأول للولايات المتحدة ويسمح لها بتبرير وجودها في شرق منطقة سورية الإدارية.

لمواجهة الإرهابيين ، ركزت القوات الحكومية السورية وقوات الفضاء الروسية جهودهما على تحديد شبكة من الأجسام المقاتلة المقنعة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"".

في الفترة من 18 إلى 24 أغسطس  ، وبمشاركة الجيش الروسي ، أعدت القوات الحكومية في منطقة سوريا الإدارية  الخاصة ونفذت عملية واسعة النطاق لدحر تشكيلات العصابات.

أدت الضربات الجوية السورية ونيران المدفعية وأعمال مجموعات الاستطلاع والبحث الخاصة في ""الصحراء البيضاء"" إلى تصفية 327 مسلحاً وتدمير 134 مأوى و 17 نقطة مراقبة وسبعة مخازن عتاد وخمسة مخازن تحت الأرض للأسلحة والذخيرة.

ستستمر عملية تطهير ""الصحراء البيضاء"" من فلول عصابات اللصوص حتى التدمير الكامل للجماعات المسلحة التي تسيطر عليها الولايات المتحدة العاملة هناك. إن  تحرير هذه الأراضي من الجماعات الإرهابية التي تسيطر عليها الولايات  المتحدة الأمريكية أمر ضروري لاستعادة وحدة أراضي الجمهورية السورية. في  الوقت الحالي ، هناك معارضة نشطة لقوات حكومة بشار الأسد من الجماعات  المسلحة غير الشرعية ، إلا أن القوات المسلحة السورية تبذل كل ما في وسعها  لتدمير الدفع الأخير للإرهاب في البلاد.",1598509929.0,syrianconflict

A Syrian military source confirmed that Israeli F-15 fighter-bomber aircraft conducted the dawn attack on 9 April by firing eight missiles at T-4 Airbase from Lebanese airspace.

Syrian air defenses confronted these missiles and shot down five of them.

Fourteen people died in the attack, including four Iranian military advisers. One of the Iranians was a colonel who commanded the Iranian drone program.

***Comment***

The Israelis attacked the Iranian facilities at T-4 in February and in the large air raid that retaliated for the downing of an Israeli F-16 during the earlier attack.

The Israelis, as is their practice, did not comment on the attack. The timing of the attack indicates Israeli leaders perceived an opportunity to attack Iran under the cover of US threats to punish Syria over the alleged gas attack in Douma. The Syrians were on alert for an American attack but got an Israeli attack instead.

#**Russia's stance**

The Russians continue to defend Syria. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on 9 April that the Russian military in Syria have repeatedly warned of provocations aimed at blaming Damascus for the use of chemical weapons.

The Russian Centre for Reconciliation in Syria said Russian specialists inspected the site of the alleged chemical attack on the 9th and said there was no trace of chemical agents.

The Syrian Red Crescent also issued a statement on 9 April that its medical personnel in Douma had found no evidence that a chemical attack had taken place. The Red Crescent runs a hospital in Douma. It received no patients that were exposed to chemical agents over the weekend, despite claims by the White Helmets that hundreds were wounded from exposure to chemicals.

***Comment***

This is the first report that Russian specialists already visited the site. The Russian visit will change no minds. Many will doubt anything the Russians claim. But unlike the western powers, the Russians at least said they tried get evidence. Western states have not even done that much.

If the site is accessible to the Russian specialists and to the Red Crescent, it ought to be accessible to western specialists. The Syrians intend to declare Douma a terror-free zone.

We repeat our warning that we judge the Russians are serious about the threat of “grave consequences” if the US attacks Syrian forces.  The Israeli attack has deprived the US of the benefit of whatever reluctance the Russians might have had. 

The Israelis have again embarrassed the Syrians and the Russians.  They have provided Russia with a strong incentive to retaliate for additional attacks this week. A US attack against the Syrians that went unanswered would devalue the promise of Russian protection and diminish the stature of Russian arms.",1523387669.0,syrianconflict

The Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism meeting in Riyadh on Sunday, 26 November, focused on the importance of the media in fighting terrorism.  Defense ministers from 41 Arab and Islamic states attended. 

According to Al Arabiya, “The alliance introduced an extended and in-depth vision on ways and mechanisms to combat terrorism which surpass the military coordination between these countries. The vision puts intellectual and media fields at the center of the alliance’s joint missions. “

“According to the alliance, international efforts to fight terrorism include combating terrorist organizations’ media discourse and their attempts to lure the minds of youth.”

***Comment***

This alliance is supposedly the Saudi/Sunni version of NATO. This report is the first recent mention of any activity by the alliance. This is the organization led by retired Pakistani General Raheel Sharif. 
The insights are underwhelming, but justify no commitment of military resources by shifting a portion of the counter-terrorism mission to government information services.

#**Syrian Talks**

The eighth round of UN-sponsored political settlement talks begin in Geneva on 28 November.  The Syrian government delegation has delayed its arrival because the Syrian opposition continues to insist that President Assad must leave office before a political transition may begin.

Meanwhile, Russian press reported that Russian leaders have decided to schedule the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in February 2018.

***Comment***

The negotiators from the Syrian opposition coalition continue to make demands as if their fighting groups won the civil war. Their demands have changed little despite the declining fortunes of their groups on the battlefield. That portends another unproductive UN-sponsored negotiating session and no progress towards a political settlement.

#**Lebanon**

On 27 November, Arab media quoted Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri as saying that he would like to remain prime minister, but he threatened that he would resign unless Hizballah stopped meddling in regional affairs.

***Comment***

Hariri returned to Beirut on 21 November and agreed to suspend his resignation at the request of President Aoun. Hariri has not explained his sojourn in Saudi Arabia, his resignation announcement there nor his subsequent travels to Paris and back to Beirut. He said he was keeping this information to himself.

He seems to be carrying a pro-Saudi/pro-Sunni message that Hizballah has undermined Lebanese regional neutrality and upset the multi-sectarian political balance in the Beirut government.

Hizballah has used Lebanon as a base for its operations as the Iranian “foreign legion” in Syria and Iraq, in coordination with the Quds Force of the Iranian Islamic Revolution Guards Corps.

Hizballah leader Nasrallah said that Hizballah operations in Syria would be winding down soon. The group’s fighting units and returning personnel require time to rest and refit after at least three years of combat to prop up the Syrian government.  Hizballah will lower its regional profile regardless of Hariri’s demand that it must change its operations. It also can afford to lower its political profile without reducing its actual influence.  For a time, Hariri will look like a political master…probably until the next crisis with Israel.

NightWatch Report: Baghdad rejects KRGs offer & Lebanons PM resigns,5,7b4pjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/7b4pjf/nightwatch_report_baghdad_rejects_krgs_offer/,0,1509969894.0,"#**Iraq**

On 2 November, the armed wing of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq said that the Baghdad government is ""not interested"" in a proposal to deploy federal and Kurdish troops at the country's border crossing with Turkey.

The KRG said the joint deployment represented ""a goodwill gesture and trust-building exercise that ensures a limited and temporary arrangement until an agreement is reached in accordance with the Iraqi constitution."" the KRG said in a statement.

***Comment***

The Iraqi government position was that the KRG offer was a ruse to gain more time for the Kurds to strengthen their defenses. 
Over the weekend, open sources reported no significant clashes or military movements.

#**Lebanon**

In a televised address from Saudi Arabia on 4 November, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri announced his resignation from the office he has held since December 2016.
He said he resigned because he feared he would be assassinated, as his father Rafik al-Hariri was in 2005.  He blamed Iran and its proxy, Hizballah. He said,

“I point frankly and without evasion to Iran, which sows sedition, destruction, and havoc everywhere it goes, as proven by its meddling in the domestic affairs of the Arab nation: in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain, and Yemen.”
“It is driven to do so by a deep-rooted grudge against the Arab nation and a wild desire to destroy and control it. Unfortunately, it found among our sons someone to cooperate with it, to openly announce their allegiance to it, and to attempt to abduct Lebanon from its Arab and international environment, with all the values and ideals it represents; by that I mean Hizballah, the Iranian arm, not only in Lebanon, but also in the Arab world.”

The president of Lebanon said he would not accept the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri until he returned from Saudi Arabia, palace sources said on 5 November.

***Comment***

This announcement from Saudi Arabia is unprecedented. It appears to reinforce Hariri’s fear of assassination and suggests that an attempt on his life was imminent.

The resignation has generated a flood of commentaries and assessments. Those that are pro-Sunni Arab support Hariri’s accusations.

Our hypothesis is that the resignation is a part of a blocking move in the struggle between the Saudis and the Iranians. The Saudis backed Hariri, but during his tenure, Hizballah’s influence and strength increased. Several commentators said the Saudis are looking for a stronger Sunni advocate in Beirut who can deny the Iranians access to the Mediterranean Sea via Lebanon.

In our hypothesis, Lebanon is in danger of becoming another political battle ground in the struggle between the Arabs and the Iranians.  It is another ripple effect from the outcome of the Syrian civil war that leaves the Assad government in control in Damascus, with the help of the Iranians and Hizballah.

#Bahrain's Reaction

Bahrain ordered all its citizens in Lebanon to ""leave immediately"". Bahrain's Foreign Ministry said its citizens are banned from traveling to Lebanon, as well.

***Comment***

One analyst wrote that Bahrain is a bellwether for the Gulf Cooperation Council in announcing sanctions and travel bans. If so, similar responses are likely from other Gulf countries.",1509969894.0,syrianconflict

#Barazani Steps Down

On 29 October, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region Parliament approved President Masoud Barzani's request to step down from his post on 1 November.

On Saturday, 28 October, Barzani announced that he would not extend his presidential term past 1 November. His term is due to expire on 1 November in any event. He said he would not extend his term under any conditions.

He also said, “I am the same Masoud Barzani, I am a Peshmerga (Kurdish fighter) and will continue to help my people in their struggle for independence.”

During the parliamentary session on the 29th, demonstrators broke into the Kurdistan Region parliament building in Irbil to protest Barzani’s decision to step down.

The regional parliament also passed Barzani’s plan to distribute the president’s powers among the government, parliament and judiciary. Barzani outlined the division of powers in his resignation letter.

***Comment***

The law on the distribution and division of powers apparently will convert the regional government into a parliamentary system, instead of the current presidential system.

Barzani is paying the price for his miscalculation of Iraqi willingness to compromise and of international support for an independent Kurdistan.

The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which is the rival to Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), is in the process of conducting its own investigation of what transpired in the Kurdish withdrawal from Kirkuk. That event was the start of the greatest setback to Kurdish aspirations for independence.

#**Spain**

#Catalan secession

On 27 October, the Catalan parliament declared the province independent by majority vote -- 70 lawmakers out of 135 in the regional parliament voted to declare Catalonia “a republic in the form of an independent and sovereign state.”

On 28 October, the Spanish Senate earlier gave Rajoy’s government sweeping powers to impose direct rule on the wealthy, semi-autonomous region to quash its independence drive.

Almost immediately Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament, took over the administration and called a snap election for 21 December to replace the provincial government. Rajoy designated Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz Santamaria to oversee the process.

""We believe it is urgent to listen to Catalan citizens, to all of them, so that they can decide their future and nobody can act outside the law on their behalf,"" Rajoy said in a televised speech.

Rajoy said he formally removed Catalonia’s separatist leader Carles Puigdemont and his executive from office as part of measures to “restore normality.”  “We Spaniards are living through a sad day in which a lack of reason prevailed upon the law and demolished democracy in Catalonia.”

Madrid also dismissed Catalan regional government representatives “around the world,” except for the one in Brussels.

***Comment***

 Although some 92 percent of those who voted approved independence from Spain in the 1 October referendum, only 43 percent of the eligible voters participated. This is an important part of the context for Prime Minister Rajoy’s statement the pro-independence activists destroyed democracy.

#Catalan Police

In an effort to defuse tensions, the regional police force urged its officers not to take sides. Government buildings, the headquarters of national political parties, ports, airports, courts, and the Bank of Spain were being guarded, the Interior Ministry said. Units of the regional force could be replaced if events made that necessary, it said.

The Madrid government dismissed the chief of the regional police force, known as the Mossos d’Esquadria, the official gazette announced on Saturday, 28 October, for failing to execute orders from Madrid. He is responsible for the decision to not take sides.

#Demonstrations in Barcelona

Hundreds of thousands gathered in central Barcelona on 29 October to call for Spanish unity. The demonstration was convened by the anti-independence group Societat Civil Catalana, which organized a similar event earlier in October that was attended by similar numbers.

***Comment***

The demonstration tends to support Prime Minister Rajoy’s argument that the independence vote did not reflect the will of the majority of Catalans.

It remains unclear how the central government will enforce direct rule. Catalan activists have said they will engage in passive resistance and civil disobedience.

#**Kurdistan and Catalonia**

It is tempting to compare the phenomenology of Catalonia with that of Iraqi Kurdistan.  This is a brief examination of several key elements in the two fragmentation scenarios. 

#Popular Support

While both regions contain strong feelings about independence, it is unclear that a majority of voters favors a total break with the central government.

#Political Calculations

In both, regional leaders overestimated their political leverage and the probability that the central government would agree to talks. The Kurds announced that their intention was to use their referendum outcome as leverage in talks. Independence for Kurdistan was not the immediate objective. However, the Iraqi government quite simply declined to cooperate with the Kurdish political scheme.

In Catalan, the political leaders waited 26 days before declaring independence in expectation of talks with the Madrid government. As in Kurdistan, it was not clear that secession with fragmentation of the Spanish state was the immediate objective. However, the government in Madrid was as uncompromising as was the Baghdad government.

The differences are significant and important for independence.

#Violence

The Iraqi Kurds held territory that was disputed, including the city of Kirkuk, some towns and oil fields on the edges of Kurdistan.  Clashes occurred between central forces and the Kurdish militias, but the Kurds withdrew to the territory they held at the time of Saddam Hussein.

Irredentist or other claims are not relevant to Catalonia. The only violence has been limited, between activists favoring independence and the security authorities. Sentiment against using violence to preserve the integrity of Spain seems nearly universal. Some street encounters seem likely, but clashes between armed forces do not.

#Geography

As a land-locked region, Iraqi Kurdistan always will be vulnerable to a blockade by its neighbors. The costs of imposing and maintaining such a blockade might be increased by armed Kurdish resistance. However, the effectiveness of resistance would be reduced by internal rivalries and the separate chains of command for the militias from the two main Kurdish political rivals.

Kurdish independence was not sustainable without the cooperation of one of Iraq’s neighbors.

Catalonia is not land-locked and has, in Barcelona, one of the best ports in the Mediterranean Sea basin. Catalan independence would be sustainable, if unopposed.

Catalonia has access to the sea, but has no force capable of preventing a blockade of the coast.  The regional police have already declared their neutrality.

#Regional Attitudes

The Kurds announced their intention to conduct an independence referendum month ago. All neighboring states made clear their opposition to an independence referendum. Almost no observer believed the reassurances that an independence referendum was intended only to improve bargaining leverage. All of the neighboring states oppose the formation of an independent Kurdish state.

The situation in Catalonia was a bit different because European Union observers disbelieved that modern Europeans would retain their national identity so fiercely. Those impulses might be strong in the Middle East and Asia, but not in post-War Europe.

Nevertheless, the Catalan independence vote has forced states to declare their hostility to fragmentation and to altering national boundaries. At the same time, it has sharpened the sense of uniqueness and aspirations for greater recognition among some minority populations elsewhere in Spain and in Europe.",1509397853.0,syrianconflict

British Defence Minister Fallon called on President Masoud Barzani in Kurdistan on 19 September, arriving from Baghdad.

In Baghdad, Fallon called the Kurdish independence referendum a mistake. In Irbil he called on Barzani to delay the referendum and engage in dialogue under international supervision.

President Barzani’s office issued a statement that said, “The referendum will not be delayed only for the sake of holding talks with Baghdad without knowing the content of these talks or knowing what international guarantees they will have.”

The statement also said that if Baghdad “expresses its readiness to hold talks on Kurdistan’s independence for a specific period of time and if there are international guarantees for the enforcement of an agreement on Kurdistan’s independence” then Kurdistan’s political leadership would meet and make a final decision.

The statement said that after the referendum, the Kurdistan Region will “happily negotiate with Baghdad.” 

#Comment

In the coming week, Barzani and his advisors will come under intense pressure to suspend, reschedule or cancel the referendum. Even the US refuses to support the referendum, despite Kurdish military support in the fight against the Islamic State. 

The pressure will test Barzani’s commitment to Kurdish independence. The issue has received so much public support in Kurdistan that Barzani has no choice but to go through with the referendum on 25 September. 

Barzani insisted that the referendum is intended to strengthen Kurdistan’s bargaining power with the government in Baghdad, not a justification for secession. We judge that he has lost control of that political idea, if it was ever true. The Kurds are voting for independence, not for political leverage. 

This issue could blow up into another armed confrontation that would test the US relationship with Kurdistan. Kurdistan’s economic success is too great for Baghdad to tolerate the creation of an independent Kurdish state.

The Turks already have moved extra forces to the border to intimidate the Kurds. About the only country in the region that supports Kurdish independence is Israel.  If Iraq moves forces towards Kurdistan to prevent the referendum, the Kurds will resist and violent clashes will result.

During this Watch, Al Arabiya reported that Barzani said at a pro-independence ceremony that Irbil’s association with Baghdad had come to an end. Barzani demanded that an alternative to the referendum – with insurance that a guarantee is provided in response to its postponement – be presented within three days.

#**Turkey Activity on the Iraqi border**

Turkey conducted military drills at the Iraqi border one week before the independence referendum in northern Iraq. Turkish press reported 100 tanks, howitzers and artillery pieces participated in the exercises.

##*Turkish press comment*

""The maneuvers send the message that the administration of Northern Iraq needs to “be smart.” The maneuvers send the message that Barzani should know his place.""

#Comment

The reference to northern Iraq is to Iraqi Kurdistan, of which Masoud Barzani is the president.  The Turks are increasing the pressure on the Kurds to cancel the referendum on independence next week.

#**Idlib**

On 18 September Al Watan reported that Syrian leaders judge that the Idlib De-escalation Zone will test Turkey’s seriousness about ending support for terrorism.

Minister of State for National Reconciliation Ali Haider said that the agreement on the establishment of a zone of tension relief in the province of Idlib will test whether Turkey becomes a state that is not supportive of terrorism and carries out its duties to close the border on its part and help eliminate the terrorist militants within Idlib. He opined that Turkey is likely to succeed in this test.

Haidar said that the Idlib agreement and other tension-reduction agreements are limited to a certain amount of time. He stressed that if Turkey does not succeed and time expires, the Syrian government will open all options, including the military option.

""The Syrian state has one option: to eliminate terrorism and the whole of terrorism and to restore any area of ​​Syria,"" he said. Syria ""has no problem with the means to achieve the ultimate goal.”

#Comment

The de-escalation zones have a six-month time limit, but that may be extended indefinitely. The Syrians are hostile to the Turks for their role in supporting the Islamic State and other anti-government rebels. 

Russian acceptance of a Turkish role in the ceasefire contributes to regional stability, but caused strain in relations with the Damascus government. Ali Haider’s remarks come close to an ultimatum and indicate that if Turkey fails to quiet its sector within six months, Syria will not approve an extension for Turkish soldiers to remain in Syria.

The post-civil war security environment is slowly taking shape around unfinished business that preceded the Arab Spring uprising in 2011.

#**Dier Ez Zor**

Russia accused US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of firing at Syrian government and allied forces near Deir ez-Zor to try to halt their advance against the Islamic State.

The Russian military said in a statement that it had received reports from Syrian generals that regime forces east of the Euphrates River were faced with ""gunfire from the north"" near Deir ez-Zor. Moscow claimed that the shooting came from a zone controlled by the SDF. The statement also accused the SDF of opening dams on the Euphrates to stop government forces from crossing the river.

#Comment

Supposedly, the US and Russia agreed that the Euphrates River would form the boundary between their proxy forces. The Syrian government does not consider itself bound by that agreement. It is determined to liberate Deir ez-Zor without the help of the SDF.

The SDF liberated the dam complex at Tabqa earlier this year. More exchanges of gunfire are certain to occur.",1505945734.0,syrianconflict

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi formally demanded that the Kurdistan region suspend the referendum on independence, planned for 25 September, his office said on 18 September. 

Also on the 18th, Iraq’s supreme court ordered the suspension of the referendum while it examines whether the plebiscite would be constitutional.

One person was killed and two were injured at an event supporting the Kurdish independence referendum in Kirkuk, Rudaw reported 18 September. The shooting, which took place outside the Turkmen National Movement's office, targeted motorcyclists flying Iraqi Kurdistan flags.

##Comment

The two official actions taken on the 18th seem late, but provide the legal justification for using law and order forces to prevent a referendum.    
During the coming week, we expect a rise in violent incidents, especially in Kirkuk, where Kurdish control is opposed strongly.

#**Turkish tanks moving to Syria**

Turkey sent 80 military vehicles including tanks to its southern border with Syria, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on 17 September.

Anadolu said the tanks were sent to reinforce troops stationed along the border. The vehicles were sent to the southeastern province of Hatay to near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing.

Syrian opposition officials and activists said they expected the troops would continue into Syria under the terms of the Astana agreement.

Turkey's Yeni Safak newspaper reported on 15 September the three guarantor countries – Russia, Turkey and Iran – plan to divide Syria’s Idlib region into three sectors.  Turkish forces and opposition fighters would be responsible for the ceasefire in the northwest region, which includes the Bab al-Hawa crossing.

Iranian and Syrian army forces would be responsible for the southeast and Russian forces would be responsible for keeping the peace in between the Turkish and Iranian sectors.

##Comment

The Turkish news service report is the first we have seen that provides insight into the agreement reached at Astana for establishing and enforcing the de-escalation zone at Idlib. Russia, Iran and Turkey agreed to triage the governate by establishing the Russian sector between the Turkish-Opposition and Syrian-Iranian sectors.

The Idlib zone will be the only de-escalation zone to feature non-Russian foreign soldiers as monitors – Turks and Iranians.

The ceasefire talks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week, finally gave Turkey a quasi-legitimate role in the Syrian civil war, as a ceasefire enforcer.  Turkey appears to be moving quickly to assume that role near Idlib, Syria. The Turks might need tanks to help fight non-cooperating rebel groups.

#**Syrian hostility to Turkey**

 A Syrian Foreign Ministry official said that the de-escalation zone agreements reached in Astana did not legitimize the presence of Turkish forces on Syrian territory.

""Syria stresses that the agreement on establishing a de-escalation zone in the Idlib province is a temporary deal that aims at reviving the ancient Damascus-Hama-Aleppo road, which will contribute to reducing the suffering of civilians and facilitate movement to Aleppo and neighboring areas,” according to SANA on Saturday.

##Comment

Syria has never authorized or approved Turkish intervention in northern Syria, especially Turkey’s creation of a so-called safe zone near Azaz. Syria also has not authorized or approved the presence of US forces, including Marine artillery, in eastern Syria. President Assad makes both points regularly.

#**Islamist rebels oppose the Astana talks**

 Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) – the extremist coalition which includes the pro-al Qaida al Nusra Front -- announced on 16 September that it rejected the outcome of the Astana negotiations. It pledged to keep fighting government forces and their Russian and Iranian allies, and it denounced ceasefire talks in Kazakhstan.

The spokesman for the HTS, Imad Eddin Mujahid, said that the opposition factions that attended the negotiations in Astana ""were not delegated from our side.”  He expressed surprise at the acceptance by the factions of statements by the Russian delegation, which said the agreement stipulated that it applied to all those factions fighting the Syrian government.

##Comment

This is the latest example of the disunity in the rebel fighting groups that has crippled their movement for six years. The HTS and its member groups always have remained outside the framework of the de-escalation arrangement by their own choice because they refused to sign ceasefire agreements with the Russians. The HTS has never been outside the cross hairs of Russian gunsights.

Nevertheless, the Russians have maneuvered so that even the most extreme rebel groups are discussing the Russian engineered de-escalation zones. The Idlib ceasefire arrangement bypasses their consent. The three guarantors and the Syrian army gradually will besiege and defeat them, but there will be more fighting.",1505859351.0,syrianconflict

Russian-backed Syrian forces fighting Isis crossed the Euphrates river on Monday, violating a “deconfliction line” agreed between Moscow and Washington and increasing the chance of clashes between their proxy forces.

Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad crossed the Euphrates on makeshift bridges, Russia said in a statement. Local activists say regime forces are now less than 5km away from positions held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-formed alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias.

Monday’s advances in the oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor highlight how risky the battle against Isis has become, with rival forces backed separately by the US and Russia inching closer together. Any clash between them risks direct international confrontation between Washington and Moscow, some of whose forces are embedded with local fighters, potentially diverting them from their shared goal of defeating the jihadi group.

Syria’s six-year conflict has become a complex, multi-sided war. It began as an uprising against Mr Assad but the ensuing chaos allowed Kurdish forces and jihadi groups such as Isis to carve out enclaves.

The intervention of regional and foreign powers, particularly Russia and Iran on the regime side and the US and Turkey supporting the opposition, has internationalised the civil war.

Deir Ezzor, which borders Iraq, is seen as the last significant Isis stronghold, where many high-ranking members are said to be hiding.

Syrian regime forces are keen to reach the province’s oilfields, located east of the Euphrates. But western diplomats say this violates an understanding between Washington and Moscow that the US and its allies would operate east of the river while Russian and regime forces operated to its west.

Even if Moscow wanted to stick to the deal, it could struggle to rein in the regime push, a western diplomat said. “The regime is completely against this deconfliction line [along the Euphrates] in Deir Ezzor,” he said. “They think they can win this territory 100 per cent. Assad is insistent on moving into the American zone and getting the al-Omar oilfield.”

The Omar field is Syria’s biggest and most lucrative, and sales of its crude have provided Isis with millions of dollars over the past three years. The Syrian government, which before the war produced more than 350,000 bpd, is desperate to gain oil reserves to cut its costly dependence on Iranian oil.

Tensions were escalating even before regime forces crossed the river, according to activists. US aircraft struck regime troops last week, they said, while this weekend the SDF said its forces in the province had been hit by a regime or Russian air strike.

Syrian rebels say the US may also have an interest in breaking the agreement. Many high-ranking Isis members are believed to have fled to the cities of al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal on the west bank of the river. “The Americans won’t give up on entering al-Mayadeen and al-Bukamal either,” one US-backed rebel said.

Some Islamic State-linked militants besieging Marawi City have sent ""feelers"" they are prepared to surrender after three and a half months of fighting, the military said on Monday. 

Philippine forces have used loudspeakers urging militants to give themselves up, telling the estimated 50 to 60 fighters left in the city their lives would be spared if they disarm, change out of their black clothes and walk to a designated location. 

“Hopefully, we will have surrenders within the next days,” spokesman Colonel Romeo Brawner told a news conference. 

Two troops were killed over the weekend, raising to 147 the number of security forces killed in the Marawi conflict. Some 655 militants and 45 civilians have been killed, according to the army.

##*Comment*

News service imagery of Marawi City shows that Philippine forces have extensively destroyed the center of the largest Muslim city in the Philippines. The operations resemble Israeli or Pakistani collective punishment operations. The delays in suppressing fewer than 60 fighters look deliberate.

#Turkey

According to a Turkish news service, Turkey is following closely the developments in Syria and is taking measures. The preparations for operations in Afrin and Idlib have almost been completed. Two battalions have been transferred from the West to the Syrian border.

##*Comment*

Turkish President Erdogan has been threatening an operation to seize the Syrian Kurdish canton of Afrin since March, as a follow-on to Turkish Operation Euphrates Shield. 

A contingent of Russian soldiers intervened during the summer to block the Turks. The Russians have acted as the protectors of the Syrian Kurds in Afrin.

Russian leaders want Turkish military assistance in liberating Idlib from a resurgent extremist opposition alliance, led by the former al Nusra Front which was affiliated with al Qaida. The Russians would prefer that Turkish proxy fighters or Turks take casualties instead of Russian soldiers.

We suspect the statement about the redeployment of two battalions signifies that preparations continue for liberating Idlib. Linking Idlib and Afrin is Turkey’s propaganda tactic for conveying that the Kurds in Afrin are as dangerous as the al-Qaida fighters in Idlib and for assuring the public that Turkish forces are fighting all terrorists.

Russian protection of the Kurds in Afrin is a mixed blessing for the Kurds.  Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said on several occasions that Russia supports a unitary Syrian state and opposes a semi-autonomous Kurdish state in northern Syria.

While Russian soldiers keep the Turks from overrunning Afrin, Russian political leaders insist that Afrin remains governed by the authorities in Damascus.",1505280877.0,syrianconflict

Damascus: ‘There is no truth’

On a hot June afternoon, under the shadow of the minarets of Damascus’s ancient Umayyad Mosque, a group of men and women cook rice and vegetables to feed the poor when the call to prayer comes and ends the Ramadan fast. Ali Aqil, a wiry soldier in army fatigues, is standing by to help but, spotting me — a foreign journalist — he launches into what I assume will be a typical defence of President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels who have fought for more than six years to topple him.

“Any rebels who raised their guns against the Syrian army are no longer Syrians. This is an indisputable fact!” he says, smacking his fist into a hand tattooed with the name of one of 37 loved ones he has lost in the war. “I’d call whoever does this a terrorist — even if it was my own brother!”

The shouting distracts the men at the old Nofara café below but they quickly resettle into their clattering backgammon game. I ask Aqil if any of his friends joined the rebels. “Yes,” he says, and shrugs. “I still contact them. I don’t blame them. War is confusing.” Given that he has just called all rebels terrorists, I assume I have misunderstood. But Aqil shakes his head. “You didn’t misunderstand me. I still contact them,” he says. “There was a time we shared the same loaf of bread and the same glass of water. I’ve lost a brother, they’ve lost brothers too. I should forgive them, and they should forgive me. We should go on with our lives.”

Aqil cannot reconcile the conflicting beliefs in his heart and, after so much bloodshed pitting neighbour against neighbour, neither can the rest of his country — the symptom of psychic wounds Syria will struggle to recover from. First came the 2011 street protests against the Assad police state. Then came the government crackdown, and then civil war. Now, some 400,000 people are dead. Half the country of 21 million have fled their homes.

Syria today is a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem hard to fit together again. Bits in the north are held by rebels under Turkish patronage, while US-backed opposition fighters roam the south. To the east, Kurdish forces have carved out an enclave bordering the vast territory held by the jihadi group Isis, which is itself slowly shrinking as it faces attack both from a US-led coalition and regime forces. Meanwhile, Assad, bolstered by Russia and Iranian-directed foreign fighters, has reclaimed some 40 per cent of the country, much of that since Russia intervened militarily in 2015.

This summer, I travelled through Damascus, Homs and Aleppo on a rare government visa to see how Syria’s key cities, with different visions of their past and future, grapple with these questions. In the capital, I found a population desperate to move on even if it means leaving parts of their country behind. At the heart of Syria’s western territory, Homs is struggling to forget its sectarian bloodshed. Further north in Aleppo, Syria’s second city, where some of the darkest chapters of the war were fought, embers of hatred are proving even harder to put out. I was usually accompanied by a government minder, touring regime-held regions, so this is a loyalists’ story — not that of the millions who fled their homeland and face an even murkier future.

In Assad’s Syria, people are not only divided from the rest of their country, but from within. The war is not yet over, but his presumed victory has sparked fresh reflections on the fight. What did it mean? How will people heal? Can they even come together again? Across the country, you hear a constant exchange of stories about suffering, loss and survival — a national currency for a society grappling with incomprehensible change.

On my first visit to Damascus since the war began, it is clear the conflict has worn the capital down. Both its Soviet-style apartments and jasmine-laced colonial buildings look browner. At traffic stops, you find yourself in a sea of dented car doors and bullet-pocked bumpers. Checkpoints clog wide boulevards and cramped alleyways alike. The thud of rocket fire can still be heard from rebel pockets, pushed ever further into the outskirts.

Yet posters of the president, and his late father Hafez, stare down on passers-by as they always have. The slogans are the same. For many government officials, the villains are too: Israel and the United States. They see the main rebel backers in the war — the Gulf Arab states and Turkey — as mere puppets in the broader conspiracy. Syrians, however, have changed.

Down a crumbling alley of the old city, there is a bar called Cosette. Men with hipster beards sip beers and women in ripped jeans puff on cigarettes beneath a line from Les Misérables scrawled on the wall. It could almost be the city’s motto: “It is nothing to die. It is frightful not to live.”

Bars and nightlife flourished amid the war, part of a devil-may-care attitude once unusual in Damascus, the kind of place where, my Syrian friends would joke, you could meet a man driving an old sedan only to discover he had hundreds of thousands of dollars for his children in savings. Now, people spend what they have, whether it buys them a luxury SUV or is just enough to nurse a single glass of beer. Among youth who can afford it, drug use is on the rise, as is plastic surgery — perhaps the second most widely spread billboards after Assad are those for beautification procedures.

“Everyone here is trying to find a way to be happy, but something is missing,” says Marla Awwad, one of Cosette’s patrons, tapping her cigarette on an ashtray. “There was a moment when I realised that, even when I’m laughing, I’m never really happy.”

***

Central Damascus was never fully hit by the armed rebellion but many who lived through the war here describe a kind of sadness hanging over it. Perhaps that is why the urge to move on is so strong, even if it means leaving behind parts of the country still gripped by war. “There are two Syrias now. One is regime Syria, the part we can try to improve,” one politician told me privately. “The other is the zone of war — and we can’t worry about them any more. We have to move on.”

But, even here, many risk being left behind. Before the conflict, Syria was known for its large middle class. Today, about 86 per cent of the country live below the poverty line. The brain drain has sucked away those most needed, such as doctors, who often travel to several cities each week because of a shortage of medics.

The wealth discrepancy is blatant. Upscale neighbourhoods buzz with the sound of massive generators producing power for restaurants populated by men in polo shirts and women in heels, while outside, children in ragged clothes and old men missing limbs beg for change. “The middle class has disappeared. People are either very rich or very, very poor,” says Waddah Abd-Rabbo, head of pro-government newspaper Al Watan. “It is a real disaster.”

Some economists say 2017 may be the first year since the war that Syria’s gross domestic product will grow, though probably only by one per cent. But that will not be enough to help a large portion of the middle class, knocked into poverty by unemployment or wages worth less than a third of what they were before the war.

At the Souk Sarouja, a man with a face knotted in a frown approaches a market trader about some eggs but walks away when he hears the price. Nearby, Um Sawsan, a woman with weathered hands and a dull green headscarf, sells tiny vials of perfume — a substitute for the income she lost when the school where she taught was closed and her home destroyed. She wages a daily battle to keep a roof over her daughter’s head. “I feel I am living in the old Arabic saying, ‘We accepted hell, but hell did not accept us,’” she jokes. “We are falling into an abyss, when a citizen can’t feel at home in their own country.”

Sensing the popular frustration, Assad announced a reform programme in a recent televised appearance. He referred to corruption among government officials and a nouveau riche of war profiteers, who oversaw the black-market trading that kept the economy afloat under years of western sanctions but who have grown so powerful that loyalists see them as the biggest menace to Syria’s future. The president vowed to create a hotline for calling in complaints.

“It would be a good idea, except who is going to be the one brave enough to call and report on his local official?” one loyalist friend says. He predicts a growing struggle between the regime and warlord class that “will be bigger, deeper and dirtier”.

When security forces prevented a string of car bombs from hitting the city centre this July — on the same day the government said it would reduce checkpoints — a conspiracy theory quickly sprung up among some Syrians that the perpetrators were racketeering militias who had grown rich extracting tolls at checkpoints — not terrorists, as state media reported.

This is why some Damascenes say the regime is now more wary of its supporters than the opposition. “The real reckoning will come from within,” one businessman told me. “People feel like they’ve sacrificed a lot, and they don’t want to put up with this any more — and you can’t call us traitors, we’re your base!”

“Everything is out in the open” has become a common refrain. Some bus drivers keep a plastic bag stuffed with cash for checkpoint bribes right by the steering wheel. Regime supporters who once insisted the 2011 protests were a myth now acknowledge their existence. And soldiers, like Ali Aqil, no longer insist that civilians were not among their victims.

Nearly everyone is impatient for reconciliation, but that is not easy. First, because the international community seems to have resigned itself to a stalled peace process. The second reason is psychological. While Syria has changed, the basic facts of the conflict have not: those for or against the revolt remain that way.

One friend of mine, a bubbly fashionista from a loyalist family who is personally sympathetic to the uprising, tells me the only way she was able to resolve years of inner conflict was to give up on the premise that only one side was right. “There is no ‘truth’ in Syria,” she says. “There are two truths.”

On my last night in Damascus, at dinner at an ancient stone house in the old city, I posit her theory to a man sitting beside me, who laughs. “There are way more than two truths now in Syria.”

Homs: ‘We must forget’

A 163km drive north of the capital lands you in Syria’s central city of Homs, where life is buzzing, though the memories of what has happened here are everywhere. The white clock tower that once stood over crowds of protesters now looms over steady traffic honking its way past bullet-scarred shopfronts. One refurbished street may be crammed with pedestrians but turn down the next, and the only sign of life is trees emerging from rubble. Deeper inside the heart of Homs, the original epicentre of Syria’s armed revolt, there are only the skeletal remains of buildings that look as if they are rotting away.

One of these buildings is the Jabbour family home, and from the street, you can spy them living out their lives. From the shell of an upper floor, Issam Jabbour, sweating and puffing on his cigarette, can survey everything below.

Once, this street was called the Visitors Valley. “Since the war, we called it the Valley of Death, because they dumped bodies here,” he says. “I remember the date we found the first body, because it was Christmas morning, 2011.”

The body belonged to a government bread distributor, who was from Syria’s minority Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam to which Assad himself belongs. “I am sure whoever killed him used to eat his bread — it was someone from the neighbourhood,” Jabbour says. It was, he tells me, the start of a spiral of sectarian killings and kidnappings that have only recently calmed.

Sectarianism is a fraught subject in the war. Both sides are sensitive to accusations of it, and both rightly point out how long Syrians of myriad faiths lived in relative harmony. But in Homs — home to large Sunni, Alawite and Christian populations — the uprising quickly stoked sectarian tensions.

Syria’s Sunni Muslim majority formed the backbone of the rebellion, while minorities, fearing the rise of Islamists, mostly stood with Assad — particularly his fellow Alawites. Some Alawites joined loyalist gangs that attacked protesters, and were accused of massacres in Sunni neighbourhoods. Alawites, for their part, can tick off long lists of neighbours, like the bread distributor, who they say were innocent but ended up as bodies dumped in the Valley of Death.

It is likely that more than half of Homs was damaged by war, and sectarianism retains a physical presence. Sunni areas are empty ruins. Alawite neighbourhoods are battered but whole, dotted with recruitment offices beckoning young men to loyalist militias. Along a park in the Alawite neighbourhood of Zahra, a wall covered with more than 1,200 photographs of the dead is now called Martyrs Wall. It has become a kind of shrine, where mothers pray for sons who never returned from battle. Boys scan the faces, searching for a father or uncle.

Because of the Assad link, Alawites are often accused of being a privileged sect, especially in Homs, where they occupy many top government posts. But they come from all backgrounds and many are quite poor. It is widely believed that, proportionally, Alawites sacrificed the most lives defending the regime. No Alawite I interviewed had lost fewer than seven relatives.

In Zahra, Munir Hussein, a man with piercing blue eyes, is repairing the grocery shop. This is where he plans to spend his retirement after finishing his service as a pilot in an air force that has levelled rebellious neighbourhoods and is accused of killing tens of thousands of civilians. He proudly recounts “breaking the terrorists’ heads”, pausing only to smile at passers-by and shout, “Welcome, neighbour!”

“The people in those [rebel] areas are our people — but some were recruited by terrorists. It was our duty to carry out the strikes, even if a few martyrs were lost,” he says, by which he means civilians. He struggles with how to coexist, though. “Forgiveness is not just a word. A government can issue amnesty. But we need time to forget. Some things can’t happen quickly. There is a generation that has to end.”

Depending on how Homs is rebuilt, forgetting may be difficult. Some residents say the city’s layout, with different sects in different neighbourhoods, fostered estrangement and unrest. This cycle could be doomed to repeat itself if reconstruction is not carefully planned.

Before the uprising, the former Homs governor planned to remodel several central districts and poor neighbourhoods for a project called “Homs Dream”. Many locals accused him of using urban planning to push Sunnis and Christians out of central areas, while Alawite areas remained untouched. Many of those areas tagged for demolition were later destroyed in the fight to rout rebels, including the Khalidiya area near Jabbour’s house. “You could say we’re getting that construction project anyway,” he jokes. “Just not the way we were expecting.”

The new governor, Talal Barazi, has formulated a project, linked to Syria’s new public-private partnership law — the government’s answer to reconstruction. The law allows provinces and municipalities to create holding companies to organise private investors for reconstruction. Like “Homs Dream”, Barazi’s project audaciously envisages luxury high-rise towers replacing the impoverished neighbourhoods that once stood here. Critics call it veiled displacement, because no one who lived here will be able to afford to return.

“Whenever there have been these expropriation projects in Syria, compensation has been extremely low. It’s a very clear dispossession of these people,” says Jihad Yazigi, who heads the Syria Report, an online economics bulletin. “This is a transfer of public assets, tax-free, to private companies — and it will be a big boost to regime cronies.”

One of the earmarked districts is Baba Amr, the first bastion of armed revolt and the first to be recaptured by the regime. It is the eeriest of the destroyed areas. A massive poster of Bashar al-Assad rises over the security checkpoint at the district entrance. Down the road, a stage once used by protesters is surrounded by brittle weeds. Behind that lies block after block of empty buildings. This is the only place where I am not only escorted by a government minder but a car of security forces, suggesting how tightly controlled the area is. I find only a handful of returnees — children and women, whose husbands are either in jail or fighting on the frontline for Assad, a choice they say was offered in lieu of incarceration. As I leave, one woman in black clasps my hand so tightly that I half expect to find a note in my palm. But there is nothing.

***

From the outskirts of Damascus, through Homs and up towards Aleppo, there are countless city districts and villages like Baba Amr and, driving past them on the highway, one gets a sensation of passing not through a ghost town but a ghost country. There are millions of displaced people scattered across the region and the country, eking out subsistence in unfinished buildings and garages — and most of them are Sunnis.

Diplomats say this unnerves Assad’s main backer, Russia, which fears it will lead to a radicalised generation. For that reason, they say, Russia has become more involved in negotiations in the region, trying to ensure more locals stay.

On the outskirts of Homs, the once-wealthy Waer district has been brought to its knees by three years of siege and destruction, and is the latest opposition-held neighbourhood to accept what the government calls a “national reconciliation deal”, which is essentially negotiated surrender. Rebels and their supporters, who want to fight another day, are bussed to other enclaves. Civilians and fighters who accept registering for “normalisation” are cleared by security — but can also end up conscripted into the army. The opposition in exile sees this as the ultimate humiliation but many who want to stay in Syria argue there are no other options.

According to Barazi, about 15,000 people — rebels and civilians — left Homs and some 28,000 stayed. Residents say most of those who fled wanted to keep draft-age sons out of the army. Others feared sectarian massacres that never materialised and now want to come home. The governor allowed a few busloads to return in recent weeks.

But some involved in such negotiations complain that the government makes return harder by demanding returnees appear on state television — seen as a form of public humiliation — or by stipulating they bring their army-age sons. Critics argue that the regime does not want these “problematic” parts of the country back. “They have a population whose size is more manageable, whose demographic make-up is more manageable,” one diplomat said. “Harsh as it sounds, this may suit them for quite some time.”

It also suits many government supporters, such as the Toamas, one of the few Christian families who stayed in Waer throughout the war and who tell me much of the opposition cannot be reconciled with. Roula, the youngest of the three Toama sisters, worked as a school teacher throughout the siege. Some of her students’ sympathies with the rebels maddened her, she says.

One day, a mysterious voice called up on the phone, ordering her family to leave Waer, because they were kuffar (infidels). She was heartbroken. When two former students who joined the rebels heard the news, they begged her not to leave, and joined her neighbours in organising a patrol to ensure the Toamas’ safety. I am touched by this story, and later, as Roula is showing me old family photographs, I try to draw her out on it. Was it not hope for coexistence? She can’t bring herself to agree. This glimmer of hope seems flimsy amid all the stories of hatred she can recall, and so the only solution, she says, is to erase all these memories.

“The first thing we have to do: we must forget,” she says. “I must forget, because what else can I do? Life will go on. We can’t stay angry or upset. We have to forget.”

Aleppo: ‘Inside, I can never accept it’

From Homs, I travel the four hours to Aleppo, along a road where plumes of smoke only a few kilometres in the distance are a reminder of how close the war is, even when it seems so far away. The western side of Aleppo, a government stronghold through four years of war with the rebel-held east, is filled with posters declaring, “We will rebuild.” Girls in white headscarves chatter with friends in skimpy tops and bangle earrings along a popular shopping promenade, where fathers press children up to an ice-cream shop window to pick a flavour.

At a café shrouded in clouds of smoke and perfume, I meet Fares Shehabi, a parliamentarian and industrialist, who shows me pictures of his bombed-out pharmaceutical factory in eastern Aleppo, which Isis fighters made their base for a time.

Aleppo was Syria’s economic and industrial hub before the war, producing things such as textiles and plastics. At its lowest point in 2013, only 1,200 of Aleppo’s original 40,000 factories and workshops were functioning. Today, they are back up to 10,000. “Six months ago, a third of these people wouldn’t even be here,” he shouts over the music. “Aleppo is coming back.”

But across town, in east Aleppo, the rebels’ last urban stronghold before it was recaptured by Assad forces, the streets are silent. Those who venture out in the dark use mobile phones to light their way. In the daytime, the landscape of destruction is overpowering. Charred, decapitated palm trees line the streets. Many in eastern Aleppo never accepted the rebels when they stormed their half of the city in 2012, fleeing to the western side. But others stayed throughout the war, refusing to leave their homes.

In December 2016, supported by Russian bombardment, the regime forced rebels to withdraw, with thousands of supporters, into the opposition’s last enclaves of the northern countryside — or to Turkey, home to some three million Syrians in exile. The moment indisputably turned the war in Assad’s favour, but at the cost of thousands of lives. “We apologise for being unable to receive you,” reads a message on a wall emerging from the rubble. “We have been transferred to heaven.”

In the battle’s final days, Abu Ahmad, a man with dark skin and twitchy brown eyes, tried to flee to the government-held west — even as its bombs pounded his neighbourhood. Rebels caught him first. They dragged him through the streets, into an old wedding hall. For three days, they beat him with strips of tyres, stomped across his bare back, and poured freezing water over him.

He shares his story on the condition that I don’t use his real name — but not because he fears retaliation from the rebels. Instead, he fears the army, and its checkpoints that criss-cross through his neighbourhood. He fears loyalist militias who beat and extort neighbours. For the first time in years, Abu Ahmad could easily cross to western Aleppo but he is too afraid to try.

“What is the difference between a rebel with a gun or a soldier with a gun if they are pointing it at you?” he asks, his once trembling voice now booming. “The east and west are still divided. We’re still treated like we’re not part of the same city.”

Compared with Damascenes’ determination to move on or the self-imposed amnesia in Homs, resentments here offer a bleaker litmus test for Syria’s future. Aleppo’s situation could create a dynamic similar to Beirut: nearly three decades after neighbouring Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, the city still feels psychologically split between east and west, and many prefer to circulate on their own side.

Some western Aleppines’ sense of victimisation is so strong, they seem numb to the east’s suffering. They mention how they, too, were besieged earlier in the war and pummelled with lethal rockets made from gas canisters, dubbed “hell cannons”.

But the damage is nothing compared with the east, where air strikes turned buildings into pancakes. In an abandoned building overlooking the ruins, I meet a bulky commander sitting in a battered armchair. He orders an underling to bring me chilled juice, then lectures me about the conspiracy against Syria. He doesn’t trust the east Aleppines who have returned, he says, but it’s his job not to trust anyone.

“You think we don’t know that those are the militants’ wives, children, parents and uncles? Of course we do. We lost so much because of them,” he says. “But my government ordered me to welcome these people, to let them return to their homes, to treat them fairly — and so I do. But inside, I can never accept it.”

For locals, the bigger concern these days is the loyalist militias, whose commanders, they say, drive around in SUVs with blackened licence plates, beating or even shooting passers-by in the way. A relative of Abu Ahmad, a frail man with a raspy voice who calls himself a staunch Assadist, says he was shocked at how psychologically broken his relatives seemed on his first visit back after seeking refuge on the Syrian coast. He called friends in the government to complain but they said there was nothing to do — they needed these militias to finish the war. “They’re wrong,” he says. “We’re deepening a divide, an anger. It is going to create the next revolt.”

Businessmen such as Shehabi argue that reviving the economy will ease these tensions. But that requires major reconstruction funds unlikely to come as long as western countries demand an internationally approved settlement to remove sanctions. Syrian officials say they don’t want European or US money and look to Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) to fill the gap. But diplomats here insist those countries see little to gain — Syria’s main natural resource concessions have already been handed to Russia and Iran.

Another impediment is lingering hostility towards the rural populations that formed the backbone of industrial labour — and the bulk of rebels who stormed Aleppo. Some businessmen say their own employees looted their factories. “Can you imagine the spite?” asked one.

In Aleppo, westerners look suspiciously at the impoverished east but everyone in the city points a finger at the countryside. The disparity between town and country shocked even some local rebels, who described meeting families in the countryside who hadn’t had electricity until 2002, who couldn’t afford a washing machine. They worked factory jobs six days a week for men with luxury homes.

To this day, Syrians debate what fuelled the uprising. Some blame sectarianism. Others, the class divide. Others note that rural populations — desperate after years of drought, crammed into ramshackle suburbs seeking jobs — were the first to take up arms. Beneath all these interpretations lies a struggle for resources in a country running short of them, and distributing them less than equitably. In places such as Homs, Sunnis say state jobs went to Alawites. In Sunni cities such as Damascus and Aleppo, the benefits of Assad rule were bestowed on the urban and wealthier classes.

This provides a loophole for reconciliation: loyalists here rely on an interpretation of the uprising as driven by ignorance and desperation. “They had to join but, deep inside, they were not convinced,” Shehabi says. “We want them to come back. They are victims of war, like us.”

In Aleppo’s Sukkari district, where about 20,000 people, a third of the original population, have returned, shoppers buy vegetables and street vendors hawk used shoes. Adnan al-Daqas, a local administrative head, is handing out cooking gas canisters. In tones instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with Assad’s prewar Ba’ath party rule, he describes his mission as reacclimatising wayward citizens. “We explain to people that they are part of an entity called the Syrian Arab Republic. We have a president, a flag, and we have a national anthem,” he says. “People are grasping this, and they know they were in the wrong.”

Some Syrians urge loved ones in the opposition to exploit this opportunity for return: to say they were duped, and to sign up for “normalisation”. But oppositionists in exile argue this is accepting comfort over principles. They insist on waiting for an internationally brokered peace deal.

Meanwhile, their alienation deepens. On my last visit to Turkey, in a town a few hours from Aleppo, one rebel described watching his children struggle to write in their native Arabic. Some days, his son belts out the Turkish national anthem as they walk home — causing Turks on the street to stand to attention, he adds with a laugh, before burying his face in his hands. “My kids are becoming Turks,” he says.

But even for those inside Syria, home is a place that remains elusive. I remembered the army commander in his armchair, overlooking the rubble-strewn streets. When he struggled with my questions on reconciliation, I posed a different one: what had he learnt from the war? He leaned back, and stared at me a long time.

“I don’t know if it offered me a lesson. But it has given me a wish, which I hope is fulfilled. I want to go back to my village. I want to be with my parents and my friends. I want to have a simple life, and be a simple person.” When could he go home? He laughed, and shook his head. “When there are no more terrorists.”",1501756900.0,syrianconflict

I am currently reading a book about the war in Syria. In a chapter about the use of sarin gas in Ghouta the author says that a chemical analysis of remnants of the gas in the biochemical laboratory in Porton Down, England, concluded that the gas was in fact sarin, but had a different chemical composition than the sarin previously used by the Assad regime.

The author also claims that several British agents doubted that the launchers, allegedly used to shoot the gas rockets, would not have been able to cover the indicated distance.

The author, however, does not indicate any sources on his claims and Google search also does not reveal any sources on the claims made by the author.

Is there any truth to his claims? Does anyone have somewhat reliable sources on this?",1700947267.0,syrianconflict

Reflections on the American presence in Syria,2,pz8111,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz8111/reflections_on_the_american_presence_in_syria/,1,1633094965.0,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/jg5drgh7cuq71.png?width=576&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab461d265ecbab0cf66d743cb5cc0d58f2c45cd

The US withdrawal from Afghanistan has made its Kurdish allies in Syria nervous. The White House hastened to assure the SDF through a specially sent delegation of the State Department that there was no intention to initiate a similar withdrawal of troops from the SAR, but the Kurds still had a sediment. It is not even a matter of another refusal of the United States to support the political Kurdish project of Rojava. By a strange coincidence, immediately after the visit of American diplomats, Ankara sent new military contingents to the north of the country.  
What is the likelihood of Biden leaving Syria? Some American experts have noted a number of indicators that are not very good for the SDF. With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, as well as the recent creation of the AUKUS alliance, Biden made it clear that containing China is his main foreign policy goal. This means ending participation in the long legacy of the “war on terrorism” like in Afghanistan. Extending this approach to Syria, Biden may come to the conclusion that troops in Syria are not needed to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State group. There are hints of a softening of the stance towards Bashar al-Assad — the recent release from sanctions of the Egypt-Jordan-Syria-Lebanon gas deal.  
According to American experts, the SDF has reasons for temporary optimism. First, Biden was extremely harsh in Afghanistan, but he will be wary of attracting more backlash from the media if he follows the same tactics in Iraq and Syria. This alone suggests that even if Biden wanted to leave Syria, he would refrain from sharp movements until the criticism after the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan subside. Secondly, the operation in Syria is much less expensive than the operation in Afghanistan. On top of that, Syria is now less like an active theater of war, as the IS caliphate is largely destroyed.  
In addition, there is an international dimension. Biden cannot please all of his allies, but there is certainly no regional consensus forcing him to withdraw the American military contingent. Thus, at this point, even if Biden may choose to withdraw from Syria, there is little internal or external incentive for a sudden withdrawal. However, this could change. In particular, the dynamics of relations between Turkey and Russia in Syria is a significant factor, and events in Afghanistan may still resonate.  
Biden has declared the containment of not only China, but also Russia as a priority in his current policy. The Americans actually covered the southern borders of Russia for two decades for their own money and at the cost of their soldiers’ lives: while the United States was in Afghanistan and supported a regime loyal to itself, there was no need to talk about any more or less large-scale armed expansion from Afghanistan to the Central Asian region. It is more appropriate to call the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan an element of restraining Russia by forcing the transfer of part of its efforts and resources to the southern direction in order to protect its borders.  
Assad and Moscow want the Syrian Kurds to agree to a settlement with Assad and ask the US to leave. The PYD has good relations with both Assad and Russia, and there is a faction that sees the future of the SDF under the protection of Damascus and Moscow, not Washington. Indeed, when Trump allowed Turkey to invade in 2019, the SDF immediately turned to Moscow, which brokered the ceasefire in exchange for the transfer of SDF territories to the control of Assad and Moscow.  
Every time Turkey attacks SDF positions, either with UAVs or controlled militants, and Washington does not react, this adds more weight to Moscow’s claim that only Russia can protect the SDF from Turkey. Both Moscow and Ankara felt that the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan increased their chances of getting what they wanted. Even if the White House does not plan to immediately leave eastern Syria and face pressure, both Russia and Turkey will try to use the consequences of Afghanistan to achieve their goals, and ultimately accelerate the US withdrawal.  
The logic of maintaining the American presence in Syria within the framework of containing Russia can be much more effective than simply maintaining support for the SDF through the presence of a small American contingent in Syria. His withdrawal will automatically take Russia’s containment to a whole new level. Namely, it will translate this containment into the format of an almost open Russian-Turkish confrontation, which the Americans actually missed almost from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict.  
It is this scenario that is the most powerful opposition to any Iranian influence, and Russia, by and large, is not ready for such a scenario. She cannot fight the Turkish troops. The victim in the form of the SDF in this scenario is outweighed by the dividends received in terms of emphasizing Ankara’s ambitions",1633094965.0,syrianconflict
The humanitarian situation in Syria will not change without the lifting of sanctions,1,pz7d74,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianconflict/comments/pz7d74/the_humanitarian_situation_in_syria_will_not/,0,1633092793.0,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mdklh6nj3uq71.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0b639d76ca5c899b35f359e5d1365a6290f1d26

In 2021, there is a serious increase in humanitarian needs in Syria, which throws back the recent progress  made and actively broadcast in the information field to improve the  socio-economic situation of the local population. This is the conclusion  reached by the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative for  Humanitarian Affairs M. Griffiths, who had visited Damascus on the eve  of his first official visit in his new position.  
The UN Humanitarian  Coordinator cited disappointing figures on the increase in the number of  people in need of humanitarian assistance to 13.4 million people, which  is 21% higher than the level of 2020. This growth in need,  unprecedented in recent years, is returning Syria to the scale of the  humanitarian disaster of early 2017. Speaking in mid-September of this  year. M. Griffiths said before the members of the UN Security Council: —  … “The real situation of the population in Syria is much” sadder “than  those figures and data that are given in official reports.” Particularly  urgent and urgent, he said, is the delivery of aid to the  opposition-controlled Syrian province of Idlib, where tensions have  risen again in recent months and direct armed clashes between  pro-Turkish militants and the Syrian army have intensified.  
According  to UN experts, the UN humanitarian response plan in Syria in 2021 is by  far the most ambitious in the world — its budget is $ 4.2 billion. At  the same time, the real level of funding for this plan remains a record  low — in 9 months of the year it was provided only by 27%, and even if  donor receipts increase in the remaining months of 2021, it will be  extremely difficult to meet the growing humanitarian needs.  
Funding  gaps prevent international organizations from investing in preventive  strategies and measures to strengthen the resilience of local  communities and small and medium-sized enterprises. It seems that it is  precisely such measures that are extremely important in order to prevent  the further growth of the humanitarian crisis, but the resources for  their implementation are insufficient. In the coming months, the UN  predicts that the Syrian population will continue to live in extreme  poverty. This is influenced, among other things, by the fact that Syria  maintains a large network of camps and temporary settlements for  refugees, which remain overcrowded and continue to increase in size. It  is these places of stay of Syrian refugees that remain the most  dangerous from the point of view of violence and violation of the rights  of the civilian population — robberies, rape, and the illegal use of  child labor are practiced there.  
Separately, it should be noted the  growing negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the growth of  humanitarian needs in Syria. In particular, the failure of the  authorities to implement a fast and effective transition to online  education, coupled with restrictive measures, led to the closure of the  work of many educational institutions. The situation is especially acute  in the north-west of the country, where a sharp increase in the number  of cases of coronavirus is forcing the government to take tough measures  and close schools. The vaccination rate in Syria as a whole does not  exceed 2%, which does not imply effective solutions to stop the pandemic  in the foreseeable future.  
On a national scale, there is a  deterioration in the population’s access to clean drinking water,  sanitary and hygienic facilities, and medical institutions. The water  crisis is largely triggered by the worst drought this year, which has  disrupted fresh water supplies for irrigation and agriculture, as well  as hydropower in many parts of the country. This crisis is especially  felt in the Kurdish-controlled northeastern regions of Syria.  
At the  same time, despite the growing humanitarian needs and significant  funding problems for UN operations in Syria, the position of leading  Western donors towards Damascus remains unchanged. This explains the  recent alarmist statements by senior UN officials, who are sounding the  alarm and urging donors to fulfill their humanitarian obligations. At  the same time, leading Western donors continue to insist that support  for long-term projects for the economic reconstruction of the country  and the lifting of sanctions on Damascus will become possible only after  the latter starts political reform in accordance with previously  concluded international agreements.",1633092793.0,syrianconflict

Credible data collection is a bleak possibility. This is another reason that actual numbers of affected are not ascertained. As Covid-19 cases of infection are on the rise, the lack of testing and care giving equipment is only going to exasperate the health crises in the making.

The United Nations and other humanitarian organizations have warned to brace for impact. As of now, most of those suffering from poverty are either living in areas in Kurdish or rebel areas. A single functional [**Covid-19**](https://thearabposts.com/us-announces-60m-covid-19-vaccine-sharing-with-nations-under-duress/) testing laboratory is going to run out of testing kits in the next one week.

More than 5,300 cases have been confirmed in the area in April alone, according to the **International Rescue Committee (IRC)** – more than half of the total for the whole of 2020. Currently, more than 47% of tests are coming back positive. The country has primarily depended on funding from NGOs and UN aided programmes or partner nations. Seven such funding options have closed shop, limiting access to life saving drugs, oxygen and testing equipment too.

Vaccine supply has come late. The first lot has been received only last week in the rebel and Islamist-controlled north-west Syria. This is because Syria falls under the poor nation’s category and is covered under the COVAX scheme of things. Some 50,000 vaccine doses outnumber the population that requires vaccination.

Another uncertainty that hangs precariously over the troubled population in Idlib and the surrounding areas is whether; further vaccine shipments for the rebel enclave will reach elsewhere in Syria. The country might not have been hit by a new variant as of now. Meanwhile, Assad is using his political connections to receive the Russian vaccine of Sputnik-V for the population.

***Russia has been instrumental in fueling the civil war in Syria and will stand to gain from this partnership with Assad regime that is preparing for elections in May 2021.***

Campaigners Reprieve say the majority of British women in the country were sexually exploited, with many under the age of 18 at the time. A report by the group, which has accused the Government of ‘failing’ trafficking victims, says among those in a camp is a girl known as Nadia who was taken to Syria by a male relative at 12 and was repeatedly raped until she fell pregnant at 15.

Syria is connected to Egypt through the Arab Gas pipeline, which stretches across 1,200 kilometres. However, following militant attacks on the infrastructure passing through the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the pipeline has been used less frequently. While Iraq has been looking for alternatives to importing Iranian gas, relying on Syrian infrastructure may not prove reliant. Last year, an attack on the Syrian section of the Arab Gas pipeline caused a blackout across the country. The government said the explosion was the result of a terrorist attack. The proposed pipeline had an initial capacity of 150,000 barrels per day to be built at a cost of $18 billion. The two countries revived the project last year, as diplomatic relations between them improved, with the scheme expanded to include Egypt.

In March, it was 10 years since the start of the war in Syria, where 36% of the country's 18 million residents lost their homes, 6.6 million became internal refugees, and 13.4 million need humanitarian assistance. Since 2011, more than 5.6 million people have left the SAR, most of whom have fled to Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany.

Before the conflict began in 2011, Syria was one of the most dynamically developing countries in the Middle East with a good standard of living and low inflation compared to neighboring countries. According to the World Bank's GDP growth rate published in 2007, Syria's performance was similar to that of Israel and Kuwait, surpassing the regional average (5.7% vs. 5.1%).

Chronic economic problems are compounded by the collapse of the financial system in neighboring Lebanon, as well as national and regional restrictive measures in the fight against COVID-19, the sanctions policy of the West.  To a large extent, the American ""Caesar's Law"" has shackled the economic cooperation with Syria of other countries, thereby becoming one of the important factors in the complication of the situation in the country.

The north-eastern part of the Middle East region (the entire left bank of the Euphrates with oil fields) continues to remain under the Kurdish groups supported by the United States. This is about a quarter of the country and 80% of all natural resources.

A hotbed of resistance remains in Idlib, where there are still rebel forces, including the jihadists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group associated with Al-Qaeda, as well as Turkish-controlled formations.

Only 15% of the land border is controlled by the Syrian army, the rest is in the hands of external players. The same is true with the sea and air borders.

The ongoing war in Syria is largely due to the involvement of international players in the conflict. Thus, the continuing severity of the situation around Idlib is associated with the Turkish troops deployed there, and any actions there are fraught with a direct clash with Ankara. Any clash in the Trans-Euphrates region, where the US, Russian and Turkish military are present, can turn into an open conflict.

After the pro-American fighters from the ""Syrian Democratic Forces"" gained control of the oil fields, the United States in turn engaged in the establishment of production and smuggling of resources from the north-east of Syria. Further appeals of the Syrian authorities to the UN Security Council with demands to prohibit Washington from plundering the country's oil resources have not been made public to date.  

The United States and its allies, using financial and political levers, put pressure on international organizations, forcing them to ""turn a blind eye"" to the grave consequences of the sanctions imposed on Syria and the violation of its sovereignty.  By exerting a destabilizing influence on the situation in the republic, as well as by not respecting international law and the principles of the United Nations, it is impossible to resolve the crisis situation and restore lasting peace in the country.

There is no doubt that the Syrian people need to be provided with real assistance to restore the economy and ensure decent living conditions. In turn, the reconstruction of post-war Syria, the return of refugees and the political settlement are interrelated. According to the most conservative estimates, the reconstruction and restoration will take 50 years and at least 300 billion dollars. Only who is ready to help?

As the West has previously stated, everything depends on political transformations. In July 2020, parliamentary elections were held in Syria, and in August, Assad approved a new government of the SAR. The election of the Syrian president is scheduled for the summer of 2021, but Western countries have already expressed their disinterest in the election process if Assad participates in it. The same position was reiterated on March 16 by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the five countries.

Thus, today there is nothing to indicate that fundamental changes in the Syrian conflict are coming soon. The new US administration is trying to keep the remaining troops in Iraq and Syria, primarily aimed at strengthening control over the country's oil wealth. In these circumstances, only a diplomatic settlement is acceptable to get out of the current situation, where the participants of the Astana format of negotiations will try to agree with Washington and other undesirable participants on the future of Syria.",1617003677.0,syrianconflict
