Why didn't secularism take off in the Arab World the way that it did in Turkey?,3,1c09cxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1c09cxo/why_didnt_secularism_take_off_in_the_arab_world/,0,1712712536.0," Kemal Ataturk was a devout Muslim, but was a staunch believer of separating religion and state affairs and was implementing stuff similar to the *Laicite* in France today. There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas ! I feel like they are becoming an establishment with the resistance as a finality not a mean to achieve statehood, just like PLO became after Arafat.

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.

Will this Gaza war drive ME democracy progress backward?,0,1bxuq9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bxuq9s/will_this_gaza_war_drive_me_democracy_progress/,40,1712461403.0,"Before this war, although there were voices accusing the West weaponizing democracy to dominate the world, those repressed people didn't worry that. Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

 Non-Arab etiquette at a Palestinian wedding? ,4,1bwo06y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bwo06y/nonarab_etiquette_at_a_palestinian_wedding/,3,1712338532.0,"Hi/Marhaba everyone  
  
I am a non-arab Muslim getting married to a Palestinian woman soon. I have a bunch of questions about basic Palestinian wedding etiquette that I'd love to know. I know some things, but I want to know all of what will be expected from me on my wedding day. Ill give some background of how we intend to do our wedding. We intend to have it split between two days, katb kitab in the masjid, and the second day will be a smaller party in a banquet hall dinner of about 100 people (it was really hard to limit it to be this small but it's what we wanted). I would love to know even the smallest basic etiquette, both cultural and non cultural, that I should have when going to the wedding, what's expected of me, and what do I bring. I know I have to bring flowers, but how many? Do I get some for her whole family? Do I need to say something in particular to her parents? Her mom? Her family members? What kind of mannerisms should I exhibit? Any kind of dance moves I should learn outside of Dabke? Every little etiquette you can think of, I would love to know. I'm a blank slate and need to learn everything! No advice will be useless.

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away.

So anyways, I'd like to ask: is this really a thing in your country, or do the majority of people just don't care and listen to music anywhays? And is the ""no music"" rule considered to be some kind of an ultra-conservative trait in the muslim community, or is it viewed as a norm that any religious person have to follow? I'm not talking about what's right or wrong from the spiritual perspective, I'd just like to know how the society in your country feels about it, and what are your personal experiences with music being stigmatized.

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

Sanhedrin.107b

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Gittin 56b

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world.

I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Who do you think developed numerals? Was it a joint effort by Hindus from India and Arabs, a pure Hindu invention or an invention of the Islamic Golden Age?",1712131107.0,AskMiddleEast

They are from Afghanistan and we want to be respectful. So we avoid anything with gelatin or pork.

Is secularism the solution,25,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian.

Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

https://reddit.com/link/1bqnce0/video/dsr9w7lgh9rc1/player

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

1. Boycotts: Refusing to buy or use products associated with Israel. [https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide](https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide)
2. Protest divestment: Withdrawing investments from companies or institutions supporting Israel.
3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.
12. Donations: Providing financial support to organizations helping the Palestinians and fellow muslims. You can find a list of legitimate charity organizations to donate  to here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/Background\_Eye4980/comments/1box962/supporting\_gaza\_and\_palestinian\_causes\_reputable/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Background_Eye4980/comments/1box962/supporting_gaza_and_palestinian_causes_reputable/)",1711627354.0,AskMiddleEast

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,34,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid. The international community has an obligation to act"" https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/

Today (and maybe for the last millennia?) we associate Afghanistan for war and destruction. The grave yard of empires they say. Whilst foreign invasions even til recently have undeniably caused bloodshed and trauma, this was not always the case.

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,81,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

Happy Nowruz from Iran,93,1bleewy,https://i.redd.it/9s6hthpr6zpc1.jpeg,13,1711152452.0,"Nowruz is made by two words: Now (New) + Ruz (Day) which means new day, and it's celebrated in the first day of the spring, and lasts for 13 days. In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

Also, there are a number of regulars I‚Äôve often seen while scrolling through this sub., that are Jewish (according to their flairs) and often express Anti-Zionist views too. Jewish Anti-Zionists in particular tend to come to this sub. (and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

"My 48 Palis (& co.) , what are your thoughts on Lucy Aharish?",2,1bkfkn3,https://youtu.be/8LIcd7wHlCE?si=FAnPkDUo8XyMyf,2,1711050514.0,"So I have decided to refocus what little energy I have left during these horrid months on understanding life for a '48 Palestinian. All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

3 - There is an ethnic problem in the Middle East. How will he unite all these ethnicities and languages? Are we going to have one official language or multiple? What will he do with different cultures? Will there be federalism?

4 - There are tons of Muslim countries outside the Middle East and a lot of Muslims live in secular countries like Russia, India, and China. Will he try to separate them? Will he go to war to free them? 

5 - What about countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan? Will secular Muslim-majority countries be forced to join?

\- Netanyahu takes advantage of that support to destroy Gaza and annex as much land as possible.

\- A few thousand Americans will withdraw their support for Biden, which could be enough for Trump to win the election. After all, it would be challenging to convince individuals who lost 80 family members in Gaza that Biden is still a better choice than Trump!

\- Upon Trump's winning, Netanyahu immediately ends the military phase of the operation.

\- Trump takes credit for ending the war, convincing Americans that Netanyahu remains the best choice for Israel and highlighting his ability to collaborate with him.

\- Netanyahu convinces Israelis that he knows how to deal with Trump, reminding them of his achievements during Trump's first term.

\- Netanyahu's political future, seemingly doomed based on the Biden administration, is suddenly revitalized.

\- Trump resumes where he left off at the end of his first term, taking advantage of the realities on the ground at the end of the Gaza war, to broker deals with corrupt Middle Eastern leaders on behalf of Israel.

\- The precise outcome for Gaza and the West Bank remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this situation will be the final nail on the two-state coffine, a result Netanyahu has always desired, eliminating any lingering hope for a sovereign Palestinian state.

Though the path seems dark, we'll persevere, For faith in You, dispels all fear In the midst of turmoil, we'll find cheer, knowing Your help is always near.

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,5,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now. 

Russia would be fucked if NATO went gloves off, but they never would, because the Kremlin has the red button. Doesn't matter how much their arms or industry deteriorates, no one will start a nuclear war with them.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,11,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

From my research, I‚Äôve found that direct debits are indeed used in Qatar, typically for utility bills, loan payments, and even real estate installments. Setting up direct debits can often be done online, which aligns with my preference for digital banking solutions.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age.

I would be driving this monday. I would however be driving across a timezone. Should I fast on my timezone, fast their timezone? Or i even hear its not advisable to fast while traveling that much. Sources for opinions from scholars would be appreciated. Let it be noted i would like to fast monday.  ",1712559233.0,AskMiddleEast
Will Islamic Civilization fall in? ,10,1bypmfi,https://i.redd.it/ps5wtocnu6tc1.jpeg,12,1712552773.0,"Will Islamic civilization survive in the 21st century?  We see in the West a rapid death of Christianity. Having lived in France, Germany and England, I can tell you that among Europeans of Christian origin, religion is considered a relic of the past.  I remember when I was in middle school, the kids were shocked that I was truly a believer.  Will Islamic civilization take the same path as the West?  I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.  In your opinion, will there be a surge to save our civilizational momentum or will we be absorbed by the West while retaining only small cultural particularities?",1712552773.0,AskMiddleEast

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans.

"According to this paper, Russia keeps Afghanistan just successful enough to make America looks bad and considers American losing its only win (just disgusting) but then purposefully undermines stability to keep it useful for terrorizing the US. How strong is this analysis? (Paper included)",0,1bxcsat,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bxcsat/according_to_this_paper_russia_keeps_afghanistan/,1,1712413424.0,"[https://www.ui.se/globalassets/ui.se-eng/publications/sceeus/russian-interests-in-afghanistan.pdf](https://www.ui.se/globalassets/ui.se-eng/publications/sceeus/russian-interests-in-afghanistan.pdf)

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested. Any hot-headed defending of Harry will scream monarchy fetishism without analyzing the quality of skill and if it's getting people killed (their skill is extremely low, their strategy is extremely parasitic, and yes, it is getting people killed) and won't be considered.",1712413424.0,AskMiddleEast

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

Sanhedrin.107b

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Gittin 56b

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world. As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,71,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,24,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no.

"What if the French became more brutal during the Revolution in Algeria, if not outright genocidal? Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

In the interview he admits: ‚ÄúWhen you look at them and they‚Äôre burned you don‚Äôt know exactly the ages. So you‚Äôre talking about 18-year-old, 20 years old ‚Ä¶ you just don‚Äôt look on the spot ‚Ä¶ to see the ages or something like that.‚Äù  


https://reddit.com/link/1bqnce0/video/dsr9w7lgh9rc1/player

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,32,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid.

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,80,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

Happy Nowruz from Iran,94,1bleewy,https://i.redd.it/9s6hthpr6zpc1.jpeg,13,1711152452.0,"Nowruz is made by two words: Now (New) + Ruz (Day) which means new day, and it's celebrated in the first day of the spring, and lasts for 13 days. In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

Also, there are a number of regulars I‚Äôve often seen while scrolling through this sub., that are Jewish (according to their flairs) and often express Anti-Zionist views too. Jewish Anti-Zionists in particular tend to come to this sub. (and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

1 - What do you think he will do with Israel? Are we going to war? 

2 - We have a sectarian problem. Will he choose one sect of Islam and history say it's the truth and eradicate all other sects? Will you be okay with that? What about different religions in the Middle East?

3 - There is an ethnic problem in the Middle East. How will he unite all these ethnicities and languages? Are we going to have one official language or multiple? What will he do with different cultures? Will there be federalism?

4 - There are tons of Muslim countries outside the Middle East and a lot of Muslims live in secular countries like Russia, India, and China. Will he try to separate them? Will he go to war to free them? 

5 - What about countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan? Will secular Muslim-majority countries be forced to join?

\- Netanyahu takes advantage of that support to destroy Gaza and annex as much land as possible.

\- A few thousand Americans will withdraw their support for Biden, which could be enough for Trump to win the election. After all, it would be challenging to convince individuals who lost 80 family members in Gaza that Biden is still a better choice than Trump!

\- Upon Trump's winning, Netanyahu immediately ends the military phase of the operation.

\- Trump takes credit for ending the war, convincing Americans that Netanyahu remains the best choice for Israel and highlighting his ability to collaborate with him.

\- Netanyahu convinces Israelis that he knows how to deal with Trump, reminding them of his achievements during Trump's first term.

\- Netanyahu's political future, seemingly doomed based on the Biden administration, is suddenly revitalized.

\- Trump resumes where he left off at the end of his first term, taking advantage of the realities on the ground at the end of the Gaza war, to broker deals with corrupt Middle Eastern leaders on behalf of Israel.

\- The precise outcome for Gaza and the West Bank remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this situation will be the final nail on the two-state coffine, a result Netanyahu has always desired, eliminating any lingering hope for a sovereign Palestinian state.

One could argue that Netanyahu planned all these events, effectively manipulating the Biden admin and by extension the US. Regardless, one thing is certain: the Biden admin will face significant embarrassment for losing the election due to its support of a genocide!",1710991584.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,5,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now.

I am Christian Arab, however, I don‚Äôt have any Christian Arabs around me in my city in the state I reside in. I have friends that are Christian Arabs and they have family stuck in Gaza.

Although I am Arab, I didn‚Äôt grow up with the exact values of the culture therefore I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone of the Muslim faith by calling a mosque and asking if they‚Äôd be willing to donate.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,11,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Serious discussion: Why isn't anyone talking about the hundreds of Israeli security forces Hamas eliminated on October 7th? Official estimates based on the Israel social security data point out that at least 370 Israeli security forces were eliminated on October 7th.,39,1bzde7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzde7q/serious_discussion_why_isnt_anyone_talking_about/,21,1712619873.0,"Why is this fact always ignored by the media? Shortly after October 7th the media was sooooo eager to relay propaganda about 40 beheaded babies etc. Yet two months later (Dec 2023) When Official data was released the media just stopped going into detail, yet hasn't changed the narrative about October 7th.

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas !

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.

Will this Gaza war drive ME democracy progress backward?,0,1bxuq9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bxuq9s/will_this_gaza_war_drive_me_democracy_progress/,40,1712461403.0,"Before this war, although there were voices accusing the West weaponizing democracy to dominate the world, those repressed people didn't worry that. Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

There‚Äôve been several conflicts spanning generations and sides have been extremely ruthless and barbaric, for example, the Quraish against Muhammad and early day Muslims, Pakistan army against Bengal civilians, 2002 Indian Gujarat massacre, Genghiz Khan‚Äôs atrocities, Russian aggression against Ukraine etc.

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans. There‚Äôre clips, and posts on TikTok and other platforms where Israeli civilians mock the deaths of Gazans and all call for execution of children and kids (aside from adults) just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep. 

And now here we are almost a century later with American-made bombs killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Palestine...",1712354517.0,AskMiddleEast

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

Is the online campaign that Sweden kidnaps muslim children prevalent in the Middle East?,0,1bvvn16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bvvn16/is_the_online_campaign_that_sweden_kidnaps_muslim/,5,1712257451.0,"So what basically has happened is that a few immigrant families had their children removed by the social services, because they either slap their children, which is super illegal here, even a small slap on their bottom can get you jailed, pulling their children from school, which is also super illegal here, and such. 

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Last I heard, they were trying to spread this message around to a Middle-eastern channels, to spread the word.

Have you seen this campaign in any middle eastern channel? How prevalent in this campaign?",1712257451.0,AskMiddleEast

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,73,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,23,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian.

Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

About 80 percent of the population of the island are Greek cypriots. After an attempted coup in Nicosia Turkey invaded the north of the country to safeguard the status quo, but they still occupy north Cyprus, and have moved settlers from Anatolia to the north. I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey. Sorry for the novel just wanted to explain where this is coming from, I see other similarities between gaza and what happened last September in Nagorno Karabach, which is interesting given the Azeri government is quite pro Israel.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they‚Äôre terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Israel is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza,0,1bqarwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bqarwo/israel_is_making_a_mistake_slowing_down_aid_entry/,46,1711670173.0,"As an Israeli, I think my country is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza. Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

1. Boycotts: Refusing to buy or use products associated with Israel. [https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide](https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide)
2. Protest divestment: Withdrawing investments from companies or institutions supporting Israel.
3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.
12. Donations: Providing financial support to organizations helping the Palestinians and fellow muslims.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,34,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid. The international community has an obligation to act"" https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,80,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

In Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, KSA, Qatar, Oman; we don't help each other. And when an independent person comes along, showing us plans of creating pro-Arabs lobbies & corporations we can make to create a change, we dismiss them with actual hatred.

Palestine will not be liberated with us hating eachother. Keep that in mind. Nor will we have an actual life in our own countries.

Outside the fetishes of muslim brotherhood, most muslims will align themselves to those form their cultural/ethnic/national group. Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

(and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

ARABISATION BAD - ROMANJAATION OK I GUESS,15,1bkv1d5,https://i.redd.it/h0czke6fsupc1.jpeg,5,1711099198.0,"-- Kindly refer to the map if you want to talk about places

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,5,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now. 

Russia would be fucked if NATO went gloves off, but they never would, because the Kremlin has the red button. Doesn't matter how much their arms or industry deteriorates, no one will start a nuclear war with them.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,11,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

From my research, I‚Äôve found that direct debits are indeed used in Qatar, typically for utility bills, loan payments, and even real estate installments. Setting up direct debits can often be done online, which aligns with my preference for digital banking solutions.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age.

I believe that people across the world need to know more how Israel ‚Äúblatantly violated international laws‚Äù and why there is no accountability for their genocidal crimes. 

What do you think?

 If you like it, please share with your circle. Many thanks!

Will Islamic Civilization fall in? ,10,1bypmfi,https://i.redd.it/ps5wtocnu6tc1.jpeg,12,1712552773.0,"Will Islamic civilization survive in the 21st century?  We see in the West a rapid death of Christianity. Having lived in France, Germany and England, I can tell you that among Europeans of Christian origin, religion is considered a relic of the past.  I remember when I was in middle school, the kids were shocked that I was truly a believer.  Will Islamic civilization take the same path as the West?  I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.  In your opinion, will there be a surge to save our civilizational momentum or will we be absorbed by the West while retaining only small cultural particularities?",1712552773.0,AskMiddleEast

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans.

"According to this paper, Russia keeps Afghanistan just successful enough to make America looks bad and considers American losing its only win (just disgusting) but then purposefully undermines stability to keep it useful for terrorizing the US. How strong is this analysis?

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested. Any hot-headed defending of Harry will scream monarchy fetishism without analyzing the quality of skill and if it's getting people killed (their skill is extremely low, their strategy is extremely parasitic, and yes, it is getting people killed) and won't be considered.",1712413424.0,AskMiddleEast

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

Sanhedrin.107b

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Gittin 56b

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world. As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,71,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,24,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no.

"What if the French became more brutal during the Revolution in Algeria, if not outright genocidal? Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

In the interview he admits: ‚ÄúWhen you look at them and they‚Äôre burned you don‚Äôt know exactly the ages. So you‚Äôre talking about 18-year-old, 20 years old ‚Ä¶ you just don‚Äôt look on the spot ‚Ä¶ to see the ages or something like that.‚Äù  


https://reddit.com/link/1bqnce0/video/dsr9w7lgh9rc1/player

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,34,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid.

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,78,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

Happy Nowruz from Iran,93,1bleewy,https://i.redd.it/9s6hthpr6zpc1.jpeg,13,1711152452.0,"Nowruz is made by two words: Now (New) + Ruz (Day) which means new day, and it's celebrated in the first day of the spring, and lasts for 13 days. In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

Also, there are a number of regulars I‚Äôve often seen while scrolling through this sub., that are Jewish (according to their flairs) and often express Anti-Zionist views too. Jewish Anti-Zionists in particular tend to come to this sub. (and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

1 - What do you think he will do with Israel? Are we going to war? 

2 - We have a sectarian problem. Will he choose one sect of Islam and history say it's the truth and eradicate all other sects? Will you be okay with that? What about different religions in the Middle East?

3 - There is an ethnic problem in the Middle East. How will he unite all these ethnicities and languages? Are we going to have one official language or multiple? What will he do with different cultures? Will there be federalism?

4 - There are tons of Muslim countries outside the Middle East and a lot of Muslims live in secular countries like Russia, India, and China. Will he try to separate them? Will he go to war to free them? 

5 - What about countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan? Will secular Muslim-majority countries be forced to join?

\- Netanyahu takes advantage of that support to destroy Gaza and annex as much land as possible.

\- A few thousand Americans will withdraw their support for Biden, which could be enough for Trump to win the election. After all, it would be challenging to convince individuals who lost 80 family members in Gaza that Biden is still a better choice than Trump!

\- Upon Trump's winning, Netanyahu immediately ends the military phase of the operation.

\- Trump takes credit for ending the war, convincing Americans that Netanyahu remains the best choice for Israel and highlighting his ability to collaborate with him.

\- Netanyahu convinces Israelis that he knows how to deal with Trump, reminding them of his achievements during Trump's first term.

\- Netanyahu's political future, seemingly doomed based on the Biden administration, is suddenly revitalized.

\- Trump resumes where he left off at the end of his first term, taking advantage of the realities on the ground at the end of the Gaza war, to broker deals with corrupt Middle Eastern leaders on behalf of Israel.

\- The precise outcome for Gaza and the West Bank remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this situation will be the final nail on the two-state coffine, a result Netanyahu has always desired, eliminating any lingering hope for a sovereign Palestinian state.

One could argue that Netanyahu planned all these events, effectively manipulating the Biden admin and by extension the US. Regardless, one thing is certain: the Biden admin will face significant embarrassment for losing the election due to its support of a genocide!",1710991584.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,5,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now.

I am Christian Arab, however, I don‚Äôt have any Christian Arabs around me in my city in the state I reside in. I have friends that are Christian Arabs and they have family stuck in Gaza.

Although I am Arab, I didn‚Äôt grow up with the exact values of the culture therefore I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone of the Muslim faith by calling a mosque and asking if they‚Äôd be willing to donate.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,11,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Serious discussion: Why isn't anyone talking about the hundreds of Israeli security forces Hamas eliminated on October 7th? Official estimates based on the Israel social security data point out that at least 370 Israeli security forces were eliminated on October 7th.,39,1bzde7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzde7q/serious_discussion_why_isnt_anyone_talking_about/,21,1712619873.0,"Why is this fact always ignored by the media? Shortly after October 7th the media was sooooo eager to relay propaganda about 40 beheaded babies etc. Yet two months later (Dec 2023) When Official data was released the media just stopped going into detail, yet hasn't changed the narrative about October 7th.

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas !

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.

Will this Gaza war drive ME democracy progress backward?,0,1bxuq9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bxuq9s/will_this_gaza_war_drive_me_democracy_progress/,40,1712461403.0,"Before this war, although there were voices accusing the West weaponizing democracy to dominate the world, those repressed people didn't worry that. Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

There‚Äôve been several conflicts spanning generations and sides have been extremely ruthless and barbaric, for example, the Quraish against Muhammad and early day Muslims, Pakistan army against Bengal civilians, 2002 Indian Gujarat massacre, Genghiz Khan‚Äôs atrocities, Russian aggression against Ukraine etc.

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans. There‚Äôre clips, and posts on TikTok and other platforms where Israeli civilians mock the deaths of Gazans and all call for execution of children and kids (aside from adults) just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep. 

And now here we are almost a century later with American-made bombs killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Palestine...",1712354517.0,AskMiddleEast

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

Is the online campaign that Sweden kidnaps muslim children prevalent in the Middle East?,0,1bvvn16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bvvn16/is_the_online_campaign_that_sweden_kidnaps_muslim/,5,1712257451.0,"So what basically has happened is that a few immigrant families had their children removed by the social services, because they either slap their children, which is super illegal here, even a small slap on their bottom can get you jailed, pulling their children from school, which is also super illegal here, and such. 

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Last I heard, they were trying to spread this message around to a Middle-eastern channels, to spread the word.

Have you seen this campaign in any middle eastern channel? How prevalent in this campaign?",1712257451.0,AskMiddleEast

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).

>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,71,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,23,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian.

Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

About 80 percent of the population of the island are Greek cypriots. After an attempted coup in Nicosia Turkey invaded the north of the country to safeguard the status quo, but they still occupy north Cyprus, and have moved settlers from Anatolia to the north. I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey. Sorry for the novel just wanted to explain where this is coming from, I see other similarities between gaza and what happened last September in Nagorno Karabach, which is interesting given the Azeri government is quite pro Israel.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they‚Äôre terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Israel is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza,0,1bqarwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bqarwo/israel_is_making_a_mistake_slowing_down_aid_entry/,46,1711670173.0,"As an Israeli, I think my country is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza. Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

1. Boycotts: Refusing to buy or use products associated with Israel. [https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide](https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide)
2. Protest divestment: Withdrawing investments from companies or institutions supporting Israel.
3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.
12. Donations: Providing financial support to organizations helping the Palestinians and fellow muslims.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,34,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid. The international community has an obligation to act"" https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,80,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

In Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, KSA, Qatar, Oman; we don't help each other. And when an independent person comes along, showing us plans of creating pro-Arabs lobbies & corporations we can make to create a change, we dismiss them with actual hatred.

Palestine will not be liberated with us hating eachother. Keep that in mind. Nor will we have an actual life in our own countries.

Outside the fetishes of muslim brotherhood, most muslims will align themselves to those form their cultural/ethnic/national group. Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

(and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

ARABISATION BAD - ROMANJAATION OK I GUESS,14,1bkv1d5,https://i.redd.it/h0czke6fsupc1.jpeg,5,1711099198.0,"-- Kindly refer to the map if you want to talk about places

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,5,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now. 

Russia would be fucked if NATO went gloves off, but they never would, because the Kremlin has the red button. Doesn't matter how much their arms or industry deteriorates, no one will start a nuclear war with them.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,12,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

From my research, I‚Äôve found that direct debits are indeed used in Qatar, typically for utility bills, loan payments, and even real estate installments. Setting up direct debits can often be done online, which aligns with my preference for digital banking solutions.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age.

I believe that people across the world need to know more how Israel ‚Äúblatantly violated international laws‚Äù and why there is no accountability for their genocidal crimes. 

What do you think?

 If you like it, please share with your circle. Many thanks!

Will Islamic Civilization fall in? ,9,1bypmfi,https://i.redd.it/ps5wtocnu6tc1.jpeg,12,1712552773.0,"Will Islamic civilization survive in the 21st century?  We see in the West a rapid death of Christianity. Having lived in France, Germany and England, I can tell you that among Europeans of Christian origin, religion is considered a relic of the past.  I remember when I was in middle school, the kids were shocked that I was truly a believer.  Will Islamic civilization take the same path as the West?  I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.  In your opinion, will there be a surge to save our civilizational momentum or will we be absorbed by the West while retaining only small cultural particularities?",1712552773.0,AskMiddleEast

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans.

"According to this paper, Russia keeps Afghanistan just successful enough to make America looks bad and considers American losing its only win (just disgusting) but then purposefully undermines stability to keep it useful for terrorizing the US. How strong is this analysis?

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested. Any hot-headed defending of Harry will scream monarchy fetishism without analyzing the quality of skill and if it's getting people killed (their skill is extremely low, their strategy is extremely parasitic, and yes, it is getting people killed) and won't be considered.",1712413424.0,AskMiddleEast

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",88,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

Sanhedrin.107b

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Gittin 56b

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world. As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,73,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,24,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no.

"What if the French became more brutal during the Revolution in Algeria, if not outright genocidal? Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

In the interview he admits: ‚ÄúWhen you look at them and they‚Äôre burned you don‚Äôt know exactly the ages. So you‚Äôre talking about 18-year-old, 20 years old ‚Ä¶ you just don‚Äôt look on the spot ‚Ä¶ to see the ages or something like that.‚Äù  


https://reddit.com/link/1bqnce0/video/dsr9w7lgh9rc1/player

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.

But of course, i know there are other problems. I used to live in saudia for a short period before as a child and kids there would throw sand at my eyes, be verbally abusive or physically too.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,33,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid.

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,81,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

Happy Nowruz from Iran,92,1bleewy,https://i.redd.it/9s6hthpr6zpc1.jpeg,13,1711152452.0,"Nowruz is made by two words: Now (New) + Ruz (Day) which means new day, and it's celebrated in the first day of the spring, and lasts for 13 days. In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

Also, there are a number of regulars I‚Äôve often seen while scrolling through this sub., that are Jewish (according to their flairs) and often express Anti-Zionist views too. Jewish Anti-Zionists in particular tend to come to this sub. (and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

1 - What do you think he will do with Israel? Are we going to war? 

2 - We have a sectarian problem. Will he choose one sect of Islam and history say it's the truth and eradicate all other sects? Will you be okay with that? What about different religions in the Middle East?

3 - There is an ethnic problem in the Middle East. How will he unite all these ethnicities and languages? Are we going to have one official language or multiple? What will he do with different cultures? Will there be federalism?

4 - There are tons of Muslim countries outside the Middle East and a lot of Muslims live in secular countries like Russia, India, and China. Will he try to separate them? Will he go to war to free them? 

5 - What about countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan? Will secular Muslim-majority countries be forced to join?

\- Netanyahu takes advantage of that support to destroy Gaza and annex as much land as possible.

\- A few thousand Americans will withdraw their support for Biden, which could be enough for Trump to win the election. After all, it would be challenging to convince individuals who lost 80 family members in Gaza that Biden is still a better choice than Trump!

\- Upon Trump's winning, Netanyahu immediately ends the military phase of the operation.

\- Trump takes credit for ending the war, convincing Americans that Netanyahu remains the best choice for Israel and highlighting his ability to collaborate with him.

\- Netanyahu convinces Israelis that he knows how to deal with Trump, reminding them of his achievements during Trump's first term.

\- Netanyahu's political future, seemingly doomed based on the Biden administration, is suddenly revitalized.

\- Trump resumes where he left off at the end of his first term, taking advantage of the realities on the ground at the end of the Gaza war, to broker deals with corrupt Middle Eastern leaders on behalf of Israel.

\- The precise outcome for Gaza and the West Bank remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this situation will be the final nail on the two-state coffine, a result Netanyahu has always desired, eliminating any lingering hope for a sovereign Palestinian state.

One could argue that Netanyahu planned all these events, effectively manipulating the Biden admin and by extension the US. Regardless, one thing is certain: the Biden admin will face significant embarrassment for losing the election due to its support of a genocide!",1710991584.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,6,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now.

I am Christian Arab, however, I don‚Äôt have any Christian Arabs around me in my city in the state I reside in. I have friends that are Christian Arabs and they have family stuck in Gaza.

Although I am Arab, I didn‚Äôt grow up with the exact values of the culture therefore I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone of the Muslim faith by calling a mosque and asking if they‚Äôd be willing to donate.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,12,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Serious discussion: Why isn't anyone talking about the hundreds of Israeli security forces Hamas eliminated on October 7th? Official estimates based on the Israel social security data point out that at least 370 Israeli security forces were eliminated on October 7th.,40,1bzde7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzde7q/serious_discussion_why_isnt_anyone_talking_about/,21,1712619873.0,"Why is this fact always ignored by the media? Shortly after October 7th the media was sooooo eager to relay propaganda about 40 beheaded babies etc. Yet two months later (Dec 2023) When Official data was released the media just stopped going into detail, yet hasn't changed the narrative about October 7th.

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas !

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

There‚Äôve been several conflicts spanning generations and sides have been extremely ruthless and barbaric, for example, the Quraish against Muhammad and early day Muslims, Pakistan army against Bengal civilians, 2002 Indian Gujarat massacre, Genghiz Khan‚Äôs atrocities, Russian aggression against Ukraine etc.

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans. There‚Äôre clips, and posts on TikTok and other platforms where Israeli civilians mock the deaths of Gazans and all call for execution of children and kids (aside from adults) just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep. 

And now here we are almost a century later with American-made bombs killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Palestine...",1712354517.0,AskMiddleEast

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

Is the online campaign that Sweden kidnaps muslim children prevalent in the Middle East?,0,1bvvn16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bvvn16/is_the_online_campaign_that_sweden_kidnaps_muslim/,5,1712257451.0,"So what basically has happened is that a few immigrant families had their children removed by the social services, because they either slap their children, which is super illegal here, even a small slap on their bottom can get you jailed, pulling their children from school, which is also super illegal here, and such. 

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Last I heard, they were trying to spread this message around to a Middle-eastern channels, to spread the word.

Have you seen this campaign in any middle eastern channel? How prevalent in this campaign?",1712257451.0,AskMiddleEast

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,72,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,27,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian.

Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

About 80 percent of the population of the island are Greek cypriots. After an attempted coup in Nicosia Turkey invaded the north of the country to safeguard the status quo, but they still occupy north Cyprus, and have moved settlers from Anatolia to the north. I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey. Sorry for the novel just wanted to explain where this is coming from, I see other similarities between gaza and what happened last September in Nagorno Karabach, which is interesting given the Azeri government is quite pro Israel.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they‚Äôre terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Israel is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza,0,1bqarwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bqarwo/israel_is_making_a_mistake_slowing_down_aid_entry/,46,1711670173.0,"As an Israeli, I think my country is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza. Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

1. Boycotts: Refusing to buy or use products associated with Israel. [https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide](https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide)
2. Protest divestment: Withdrawing investments from companies or institutions supporting Israel.
3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.
12. Donations: Providing financial support to organizations helping the Palestinians and fellow muslims.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,32,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid. The international community has an obligation to act"" https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,80,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

In Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, KSA, Qatar, Oman; we don't help each other. And when an independent person comes along, showing us plans of creating pro-Arabs lobbies & corporations we can make to create a change, we dismiss them with actual hatred.

Palestine will not be liberated with us hating eachother. Keep that in mind. Nor will we have an actual life in our own countries.

Outside the fetishes of muslim brotherhood, most muslims will align themselves to those form their cultural/ethnic/national group. Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

(and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

ARABISATION BAD - ROMANJAATION OK I GUESS,13,1bkv1d5,https://i.redd.it/h0czke6fsupc1.jpeg,5,1711099198.0,"-- Kindly refer to the map if you want to talk about places

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,5,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now. 

Russia would be fucked if NATO went gloves off, but they never would, because the Kremlin has the red button. Doesn't matter how much their arms or industry deteriorates, no one will start a nuclear war with them.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,12,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

From my research, I‚Äôve found that direct debits are indeed used in Qatar, typically for utility bills, loan payments, and even real estate installments. Setting up direct debits can often be done online, which aligns with my preference for digital banking solutions.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age.

I believe that people across the world need to know more how Israel ‚Äúblatantly violated international laws‚Äù and why there is no accountability for their genocidal crimes. 

What do you think?

 If you like it, please share with your circle. Many thanks!

Will Islamic Civilization fall in? ,10,1bypmfi,https://i.redd.it/ps5wtocnu6tc1.jpeg,12,1712552773.0,"Will Islamic civilization survive in the 21st century?  We see in the West a rapid death of Christianity. Having lived in France, Germany and England, I can tell you that among Europeans of Christian origin, religion is considered a relic of the past.  I remember when I was in middle school, the kids were shocked that I was truly a believer.  Will Islamic civilization take the same path as the West?  I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.  In your opinion, will there be a surge to save our civilizational momentum or will we be absorbed by the West while retaining only small cultural particularities?",1712552773.0,AskMiddleEast

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans.

"According to this paper, Russia keeps Afghanistan just successful enough to make America looks bad and considers American losing its only win (just disgusting) but then purposefully undermines stability to keep it useful for terrorizing the US. How strong is this analysis?

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested. Any hot-headed defending of Harry will scream monarchy fetishism without analyzing the quality of skill and if it's getting people killed (their skill is extremely low, their strategy is extremely parasitic, and yes, it is getting people killed) and won't be considered.",1712413424.0,AskMiddleEast

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

Sanhedrin.107b

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Gittin 56b

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world. As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,70,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,25,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no.

"What if the French became more brutal during the Revolution in Algeria, if not outright genocidal? Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

In the interview he admits: ‚ÄúWhen you look at them and they‚Äôre burned you don‚Äôt know exactly the ages. So you‚Äôre talking about 18-year-old, 20 years old ‚Ä¶ you just don‚Äôt look on the spot ‚Ä¶ to see the ages or something like that.‚Äù  


https://reddit.com/link/1bqnce0/video/dsr9w7lgh9rc1/player

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,32,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid.

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,79,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

Happy Nowruz from Iran,90,1bleewy,https://i.redd.it/9s6hthpr6zpc1.jpeg,13,1711152452.0,"Nowruz is made by two words: Now (New) + Ruz (Day) which means new day, and it's celebrated in the first day of the spring, and lasts for 13 days. In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

Also, there are a number of regulars I‚Äôve often seen while scrolling through this sub., that are Jewish (according to their flairs) and often express Anti-Zionist views too. Jewish Anti-Zionists in particular tend to come to this sub. (and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

1 - What do you think he will do with Israel? Are we going to war? 

2 - We have a sectarian problem. Will he choose one sect of Islam and history say it's the truth and eradicate all other sects? Will you be okay with that? What about different religions in the Middle East?

3 - There is an ethnic problem in the Middle East. How will he unite all these ethnicities and languages? Are we going to have one official language or multiple? What will he do with different cultures? Will there be federalism?

4 - There are tons of Muslim countries outside the Middle East and a lot of Muslims live in secular countries like Russia, India, and China. Will he try to separate them? Will he go to war to free them? 

5 - What about countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan? Will secular Muslim-majority countries be forced to join?

\- Netanyahu takes advantage of that support to destroy Gaza and annex as much land as possible.

\- A few thousand Americans will withdraw their support for Biden, which could be enough for Trump to win the election. After all, it would be challenging to convince individuals who lost 80 family members in Gaza that Biden is still a better choice than Trump!

\- Upon Trump's winning, Netanyahu immediately ends the military phase of the operation.

\- Trump takes credit for ending the war, convincing Americans that Netanyahu remains the best choice for Israel and highlighting his ability to collaborate with him.

\- Netanyahu convinces Israelis that he knows how to deal with Trump, reminding them of his achievements during Trump's first term.

\- Netanyahu's political future, seemingly doomed based on the Biden administration, is suddenly revitalized.

\- Trump resumes where he left off at the end of his first term, taking advantage of the realities on the ground at the end of the Gaza war, to broker deals with corrupt Middle Eastern leaders on behalf of Israel.

\- The precise outcome for Gaza and the West Bank remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this situation will be the final nail on the two-state coffine, a result Netanyahu has always desired, eliminating any lingering hope for a sovereign Palestinian state.

One could argue that Netanyahu planned all these events, effectively manipulating the Biden admin and by extension the US. Regardless, one thing is certain: the Biden admin will face significant embarrassment for losing the election due to its support of a genocide!",1710991584.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,6,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now.

I am Christian Arab, however, I don‚Äôt have any Christian Arabs around me in my city in the state I reside in. I have friends that are Christian Arabs and they have family stuck in Gaza.

Although I am Arab, I didn‚Äôt grow up with the exact values of the culture therefore I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone of the Muslim faith by calling a mosque and asking if they‚Äôd be willing to donate.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,10,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Serious discussion: Why isn't anyone talking about the hundreds of Israeli security forces Hamas eliminated on October 7th? Official estimates based on the Israel social security data point out that at least 370 Israeli security forces were eliminated on October 7th.,38,1bzde7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzde7q/serious_discussion_why_isnt_anyone_talking_about/,21,1712619873.0,"Why is this fact always ignored by the media? Shortly after October 7th the media was sooooo eager to relay propaganda about 40 beheaded babies etc. Yet two months later (Dec 2023) When Official data was released the media just stopped going into detail, yet hasn't changed the narrative about October 7th.

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas !

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

There‚Äôve been several conflicts spanning generations and sides have been extremely ruthless and barbaric, for example, the Quraish against Muhammad and early day Muslims, Pakistan army against Bengal civilians, 2002 Indian Gujarat massacre, Genghiz Khan‚Äôs atrocities, Russian aggression against Ukraine etc.

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans. There‚Äôre clips, and posts on TikTok and other platforms where Israeli civilians mock the deaths of Gazans and all call for execution of children and kids (aside from adults) just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep. 

And now here we are almost a century later with American-made bombs killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Palestine...",1712354517.0,AskMiddleEast

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",84,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

Is the online campaign that Sweden kidnaps muslim children prevalent in the Middle East?,0,1bvvn16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bvvn16/is_the_online_campaign_that_sweden_kidnaps_muslim/,5,1712257451.0,"So what basically has happened is that a few immigrant families had their children removed by the social services, because they either slap their children, which is super illegal here, even a small slap on their bottom can get you jailed, pulling their children from school, which is also super illegal here, and such. 

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

Last I heard, they were trying to spread this message around to a Middle-eastern channels, to spread the word.

Have you seen this campaign in any middle eastern channel? How prevalent in this campaign?",1712257451.0,AskMiddleEast

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,76,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,24,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian.

Some will say ""Sharia will protect religious freedom"" Yeah! Right! Good luck with that! Ask any imam if infidels can build temples and he will say no. Just ask yourself an honest question. Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no. Unless, you invent a new sharia, there won't be religious freedom. Liberal values will protect everyone including Muslims and especially Muslim minorties who are facing a lot of prosecuation.

Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

About 80 percent of the population of the island are Greek cypriots. After an attempted coup in Nicosia Turkey invaded the north of the country to safeguard the status quo, but they still occupy north Cyprus, and have moved settlers from Anatolia to the north. I don't want to sound like Greek cypriots were innocent here as EIOKA and other groups attacked Turkish cup riots but what Cypriots want to happen is somewhat overshadowed by Turkey. Sorry for the novel just wanted to explain where this is coming from, I see other similarities between gaza and what happened last September in Nagorno Karabach, which is interesting given the Azeri government is quite pro Israel.

98% of the time when native Arabs are shown in American media, they‚Äôre terrorists. Even in the cases where woke Hollywood folks decide to portray an Arab positively, it makes them look exotic and unrelatable. 

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Israel is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza,0,1bqarwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bqarwo/israel_is_making_a_mistake_slowing_down_aid_entry/,46,1711670173.0,"As an Israeli, I think my country is making a mistake slowing down aid entry into Gaza. Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

1. Boycotts: Refusing to buy or use products associated with Israel. [https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide](https://bdsmovement.net/Act-Now-Against-These-Companies-Profiting-From-Genocide)
2. Protest divestment: Withdrawing investments from companies or institutions supporting Israel.
3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.
12. Donations: Providing financial support to organizations helping the Palestinians and fellow muslims.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,34,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid. The international community has an obligation to act"" https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,80,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

In Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, KSA, Qatar, Oman; we don't help each other. And when an independent person comes along, showing us plans of creating pro-Arabs lobbies & corporations we can make to create a change, we dismiss them with actual hatred.

Palestine will not be liberated with us hating eachother. Keep that in mind. Nor will we have an actual life in our own countries.

Outside the fetishes of muslim brotherhood, most muslims will align themselves to those form their cultural/ethnic/national group. Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

(and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

ARABISATION BAD - ROMANJAATION OK I GUESS,14,1bkv1d5,https://i.redd.it/h0czke6fsupc1.jpeg,5,1711099198.0,"-- Kindly refer to the map if you want to talk about places

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,4,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now. 

Russia would be fucked if NATO went gloves off, but they never would, because the Kremlin has the red button. Doesn't matter how much their arms or industry deteriorates, no one will start a nuclear war with them.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,10,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

From my research, I‚Äôve found that direct debits are indeed used in Qatar, typically for utility bills, loan payments, and even real estate installments. Setting up direct debits can often be done online, which aligns with my preference for digital banking solutions.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age.

I believe that people across the world need to know more how Israel ‚Äúblatantly violated international laws‚Äù and why there is no accountability for their genocidal crimes. 

What do you think?

 If you like it, please share with your circle. Many thanks!

Will Islamic Civilization fall in? ,10,1bypmfi,https://i.redd.it/ps5wtocnu6tc1.jpeg,12,1712552773.0,"Will Islamic civilization survive in the 21st century?  We see in the West a rapid death of Christianity. Having lived in France, Germany and England, I can tell you that among Europeans of Christian origin, religion is considered a relic of the past.  I remember when I was in middle school, the kids were shocked that I was truly a believer.  Will Islamic civilization take the same path as the West?  I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.  In your opinion, will there be a surge to save our civilizational momentum or will we be absorbed by the West while retaining only small cultural particularities?",1712552773.0,AskMiddleEast

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans.

"According to this paper, Russia keeps Afghanistan just successful enough to make America looks bad and considers American losing its only win (just disgusting) but then purposefully undermines stability to keep it useful for terrorizing the US. How strong is this analysis?

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested. Any hot-headed defending of Harry will scream monarchy fetishism without analyzing the quality of skill and if it's getting people killed (their skill is extremely low, their strategy is extremely parasitic, and yes, it is getting people killed) and won't be considered.",1712413424.0,AskMiddleEast

During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep.

"The Nature of the ongoing War in the Sudan.
",86,1bwkskn,https://v.redd.it/73b7f2z4iosc1,19,1712330646.0,"
*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.

This lead to some Swedish youtubers starting a campaign, trying to spread the message that Sweden is intentionally targetting muslim families, with fake news such as them doing it because they wanted to make them christian, or because they are just plain racist. I just want to clarify. It doesn't matter if you are white, brown or black. If you slap your child, or deny them access to school, you will have your child taken away. It's not a targetted effort by our social services and lots of non-immigrant Swedes also have their children taken away if they do these things.

New Testament says he was killed by Romans, but Talmud claim that he is killed by Jews.  


>On Passover Eve they hung the corpse of Jesus the Nazarene after they killed him by way of stoning. And a crier went out before him for forty days, publicly proclaiming: Jesus the Nazarene is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited people to idol worship, and led the Jewish people astray. Anyone who knows of a reason to acquit him should come forward and teach it on his behalf. And the court did not find a reason to acquit him, and so they stoned him and hung his corpse on Passover eve.

Sanhedrin.107b

 Jesus was such a naughty boy.

>Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya understood the message, arose, came, and happened to arrive at a certain inn on the way to Jerusalem. They treated him with great honor. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said: How beautiful is this inn. Jesus, his student, said to him: But my teacher, the eyes of the innkeeper‚Äôs wife are narrow \[terutot\]. Yehoshua ben Pera·∏•ya said to him: Wicked one! Do you involve yourself with regard to that matter, the appearance of a married woman? He produced four hundred shofarot and ostracized him.

Gittin 56b

Jesus is literally boiling in shit hell......

>Onkelos then went and raised Jesus the Nazarene from the grave through necromancy. Onkelos said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Jesus said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them in this world? Jesus said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek, for anyone who touches them is regarded as if he were touching the apple of his eye (see Zechariah 2:12).   
>  
>Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus said to him: He is punished with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement. And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: Come and see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world. As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.

Why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? ,73,1bung40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bung40/why_hasnt_iran_developed_a_nuke_yet/,89,1712133017.0,"So Iranian war crimes aside and my hatred towards their regime aside. I do still want Iran to have a nuke. This will help balance the power a little bit between the west/Israel and the Middle East.

Currently we can see how easily Israel can attack Syria and kill Syrian civilians as well as Iranians just for the sake of intimidating Iran. 

There is no major threat to Israel as it stands. No one can stand up to them in the region including Iran. They can literally do whatever they want and it's humiliating. The threat of American retaliation for Israel keeps Iran submissive.

However if Iran has nukes the US would be much less likely to consider war with Iran which means Iran can more easily be a more serious threat to Israel without the fear on a possible regime change attempt by the US.

So the question is why hasn't Iran developed a nuke yet? I doubt they have it and are hiding it because it would be in their best interest to let the world know they have a nuke.

Also there is no longer a deal between Iran and the US. 

From what I've heard it takes about a billion dollars and 5 years to develop a nuke. Iran also has many bright minds. I can't understand why they don't have a nuke by now.

Is secularism the solution,23,1btqyki,https://i.redd.it/vpnzy45e60sc1.jpeg,105,1712036126.0,"After reflection, I tend to think that secularism is not as neutral as it seems.  I know that many liberals in the Muslim world see secularism as the holy grail that will allow their country to become a developed country.  Secularism comes first from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe nation state born in the last 200 years, the nation state to emerge and lead needs to dissolve all competing social structures (religious groups, tribal groups etc.), so that  All that remains is for the state and the individual to be torn away from all these normative organic groups.  The term religio from which religion comes originally meant a set of obligations and social normal.  Religion is not just a set of abstract beliefs or private practices.  I have the impression that Western secularism tends to reduce religion to a high school sports club.  The secular nation state cuts off a very large part of religion, removes a huge part of its function, add to this the materialist prejudices in scientific circles, and the progress in terms of comfort, it is normal that Christianity is dying  in Europe.  I think that the Muslim world must chart its own course and that the Western conception of the state, religion and their relationship is not necessarily an absolute truth.  In my opinion, all this brings us back to the debate between liberalism and communatarianism to know which of the free individual or community belonging takes precedence.  Muslim countries should invest more in communitarianism, create multi-faith states, it is obvious that a religion is part of the identity of a people, it shapes and educates this people, making it one of the state religions  seems tyrannical to me, Western states do impose an official language, borders and a national identity, so why not religious principles?

So i hope more people respond ( well not like i will take the answer face value. I am just try to expand pov ) since i want focus the flaw of hamas

One of my major confusion with hamas is 

- i google how much hamas member is. The wiki said somewhere 20 000 - 25 000 but until now why despite hamas member keep re grow, at least with my noob search that i not saved, hamas number keeps getting between in what that wikipedia say until at least last year 

- i used to see tweet says current hamas member now 85% minor. How true is this statement ?

- i keep see human shield argument so does idf version. My question more accurate human shield or hamas blend in with civillian quite well making idf harder time minimize civillian damage across 75 year ( but then when hamas is injured and is hospitalized why would human shield argument still present ? That will make seems not a war crime those 3 dead hospitalized hamas soldier that is killed by idf infiltrator. Even vizgerard praise the act )

- that 7 october incident about that famous shauni louk pic

https://twitter.com/sam_kb_/status/1773709431114486101?t=oRzFham43oF7QOoSDwi6Zw&s=19

Verified hamas does this or no ? 

And does it ever mentioned she is assigned idf member later base on this tweet ? ( i did heard syrian girl sometimes share hoax )

https://twitter.com/Partisangirl/status/1773673096396091731?t=lAIrFQN4bEHSs9SmzQMpjw&s=19

- why black september event seems quite rare brough up in tv debate ( though it is not hamas, but plo ) ? In twitter it still under debate but somehow the reaction is quite small imo

I am sorry if my question offense someone but hamas and plo existence and rafah as well makes me confuse how should i view the gaza civilian. I am still pro palestine despite my queer status ( i already heard stupidity slur for having this mindset ).  But idk how to see hamas as what. ",1711991553.0,AskMiddleEast

Can a Hindu or a polytheist build a temple in a Muslim country? Most won't allow. Ask any imam if someone can leave religion and he will say no.

"What if the French became more brutal during the Revolution in Algeria, if not outright genocidal? Would the FLN end up losing?",1,1brqrh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1brqrh2/what_if_the_french_became_more_brutal_during_the/,4,1711828700.0,"Years ago I saw a martial arts debate which self-defense instructor Marc MacYoung (who has a degree in history) participated. Basically the debate was asking about working manual laborers beating martial artists and used a clip from a fictional TV show of a butcher who was overwhelming a trained soldier who was well-versed in martial arts (in fact he took out a bunch of bandits who held an entire train by hostage in prior episodes). to the point the soldier who was making movements to defend against the blow panicked at some point and the butcher was able to put some nasty cuts on hi arms because he fell down and was unable to continue proper defensive movements because he got overtaken by fear. Though in the end  the soldier survived.


The person who asked the question said his relatives come from Algeria as a bonus point and were far more effective their cutting techniques when preparing for food (including cutting chickens heads off and preparing animal meat from the slaughterhouse) and also pointed out about the Algerian Revolution and rebels ambushing police and even a few military police with knives.

MacYoung made a point that being a soldier is different from fighting skills and a sa the debate continued it went off tangentially into military and history. From what I remembered MacYoung was telling the poster that the reality is that insurgencies never win wars and its the conventional army that wins wars and points out many examples like the Viet Cong getting demolished when they confronted a military force and made a mocking statement about multiple guerrillas like the French Resistance, Filipino bushwackers against Imperial Japan in WWII, and the FLN in Algeria not being able to beat the enemy until they get help from a conventional army like the American military battling the Japanese in Manila or the Allied forces commencing D-Day and other operations to force the Germans to retreat from France or alternetely the government decides its not worth spending money to occupy the territory (which he used for the FLN example)?

He adds with a  comment asking the other person who sent the question that I remember going something along this lines.

>What if the French decided to take Algeria for themselves and settle the country? They decided to start killing Algerians in every territory they send their own people from France into and rebuilt the new place for themselves with French infrastructure? You see for all the talk about all's fair in love and war, there are actual rules of engagements. You don't fight a people you seek to conquer and enslave the same way from stabilizing a country where most people don't really care about foreign occupation and just want to live their lives. In the same way an army's policies are completely different if the government's intention is to take new land for their citizens' benefits. Think the FLN will still be able to win if the French decides to goo hands  offhandle Algeria as a new settler colony? While we are at it, people remember the 6 million Jew s who were killed in WWII. WHat people don't remember is the over 10 million Poles, Ukrainians, and other Slavs along with other unwanted peoples in the Eastern Front of World War 2. If the French decided to copy what the Nazis did in Eastern Europe, do you honestly believe Algeria would win? They only could operate the way they did because of French hesitancy to do genocides in the aftermath of WWII and fear of being associated with Nazi Germany's shadow.

THen he writes the other details I posted earlier about French Resistance being saved by the Allies, etc which I didn't write in this quote because I don't exactly remember how he said it. Even the quote above is just my recollection and not the exact thing he wrote but because I remembered it much better I did the best to my memory to rewrite it.

So I'm curious. What if the French became less restraint and decided to go more brutal in Algeria. If they take it to ""wipe whole towns and cities level"" or possibly even genocide? Would the FLN be unable to win the war? If avoiding outright genocide and preferring to avoid slaughtering whole towns and cities just not being white French and being ""desert savages"" as a racist French politician from the 19th century called them during the final years of complete conquest  of Algeria , say they left it to Soviet style reprisals in the 70s and 80s in Afghanistan.

How would it all turn out in any of these 3 approaches? Would it lead to the complete destruction of the FLN and absolute victory for the French as Marc MacYoung claims? Or would none of this work and Algeria was bound to independence no matter what even if FLN and followers were systematically exterminated without any hesitation akin to Nazis and gassing entire populations they saw at subhumans? Is MacYoung wrong despite being so sure about his takes when he posted these resposnes in the martial arts discussion?",1711828700.0,AskMiddleEast

IMO, at least 95% of the lives of Westerners and Arabs are similar, but media tends to focus on and exaggerate the 5% that‚Äôs different. Personally I actually find Irish culture to be more similar to Levantine than American.

In the interview he admits: ‚ÄúWhen you look at them and they‚Äôre burned you don‚Äôt know exactly the ages. So you‚Äôre talking about 18-year-old, 20 years old ‚Ä¶ you just don‚Äôt look on the spot ‚Ä¶ to see the ages or something like that.‚Äù  


https://reddit.com/link/1bqnce0/video/dsr9w7lgh9rc1/player

The interview is part of Al Jazeera‚Äôs new documentary, October 7, which confirms that Israel itself killed a number of the Israeli dead that day ‚Äì as The Electronic Intifada has reported all along.  


In the documentary, Landau is pressed by producer Richard Sanders to explain a story he repeatedly spread to journalists last year.  


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking children,‚Äù Landau claimed to Sky News in October. ‚ÄúPiles of 10 children each were tied to the back, \[then\] burned \[in\] the bed. Something behind this is next level ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs indescribable.‚Äù  


It‚Äôs a story that Landau repeated again and again in the wake of the 7 October Palestinian military assault. His lurid allegations successfully demonized Palestinians and helped pave the way for Israel‚Äôs ongoing genocide in the Gaza Strip, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 32,000 people.  


You can watch the Al Jazeera interview with Landau in the video above, which is a clip from the full Al Jazeera documentary that you can watch on their website.  


Landau also seems to have been responsible for the definitively debunked Israeli lie that 40 babies had been executed by Hamas.  


As well as that, Landau was involved in promoting Israel‚Äôs stories about an alleged Palestinian campaign of sexual violence on 7 October ‚Äì which has now entirely collapsed.

I HATE hezbollah. That hatred stems from their crimes in syria and how they helped Assad crush the revolution.

But anyways regarding the genocide, hezbollah is a much stronger force than is hamas and they're capabilities of attacking Israel via rockets is much more advanced. 

Their intervention could help split the idf into two sides that way they have less capabilities of carrying out the genocide and the presence of that threat might deter further advancements in the gaza war. 

I mean the reason they(Israel) are going all out right now is because they aren't really giving up lives on their own side. It means they can go as long as they want in this war massacring as many Palestinians as they want because the toll is somewhat neglible for them.

With hezbollah in the war that changes.

Pressure could also be heightened on the world to end the war so that it doesn't spread and become a bigger regional war (not very likely to become a world War but would still be a bigger war).

Obviously the downside would be the casualties Lebanon would endure from this.

So do you wish hezbollah would attack Israel given the genocide they are carrying out?


**Edit for clarification in case matrix is reading and wants to misinterpret my post: hamas is bad and hezbollah is too. Only point behind the post is too ask if idf being split on two fronts may end a literal genocide. I wish no civilians to be killed and by attacking of Israel I mean attacking of organizations trying to commit a genocide such as the idf**

Not only innocent Gazans don't deserve starvation, but also the open check we had on October 7th for a strong retaliation in Gaza is no longer that open (losing legitimacy).

I *do think* the extreme violence utilized by Israel in Gaza is acceptable, as long as it is directed against military objectives (it's legitimate despite the high death numbers). I've heard claims that 50-70% of buildings in Gaza were destroyed - and that's fine by me, because that's war. Hamas is obviously using human shields and civilian structures for military purposes, which makes it acceptable to bomb many houses, schools, universities, etc, as many of them are considered military targets.

However, I also think that in order to increase legitimacy by the international community, Israel has to be responsible and do everything it can to prevent a famine. Obviously, not all the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza are involved, and besides that, expressing support for Hamas - as terrible as I think it is - doesn't justify collective punishment, even if most Gazans support Hamas now. The Israeli violence has to be directed, as much as possible, at Hamas terrorists.

I did understand temporary aid restrictions earlier in the war, when Israel was in such a shock that it seemed sensible to delay food supplies for a short while, out of both lack of ideas and frustration - but I think that phase has passed, too.

As an Arab, what have you done for the Palestinians lately? How have you helped us this Ramadan? I often see people sending prayers and good wishes - which is great, as nothing can be done without Allah's help - Mashallah - but beyond that, how are you helping? Has it crossed your mind that you‚Äôve been put on this earth in this particular moment in history for a purpose?

Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, died after setting himself on fire outside the front gate of the embassy of Israel in Washington. Wallahi, I am not advocating for people to kill themselves over Palestine. I wish Aaron was still here advocating by other means, but Aaron, an American, felt so  strongly about the genocide being meted out and unfortunately took his own life in the most painful way possible to draw attention to it.

I am not trying to guilt anyone into action, but there is so much you can do to help instead of sitting and waiting for our useless non leaders to take action, because they won't. They‚Äôre more concerned about staying in power than doing anything meaningful for muslims and the Palestinian people.

What does it matter that the US and some other countries have decided to defund UNRWA when there are over 400 million Arabs in the region? A single company in Saudi Arabia is happy to pay Ronaldo, a footballer, one man, over $200 million, yet UNRWA receives $27 million from the Saudi government.

If you would like to help other muslims and Palestinians in Gaza, don't wait for your government to effect change. Together we can achieve great things. Off the top of my head, I‚Äôve made a list of things you can do to help.

3. Demonstrations and marches
4. Civil disobedience: Disobeying unjust laws to challenge Israeli policies.
5. Strikes: Collective work stoppages to disrupt normal functioning and demand change.
6. Sit ins and occupations: Occupying public spaces or buildings to draw attention to grievances and demand action against Israel.
7. Petitions and letter campaigns: Collecting signatures and organizing letter writing campaigns to raise awareness and demand political action against Israel.
8. Cultural resistance: Using cultural expressions like music, art, and literature to challenge Israeli narratives and inspire unity.
9. Education and awareness: Organizing workshops and educational programs to inform people about the history and impact of Israeli occupation and oppression.
10. International solidarity: Building alliances with international organizations and activists to garner support and put pressure on Israel.
11. Humanitarian Work: Offering assistance and relief to communities affected by Israeli occupation and oppression through humanitarian initiatives.

But of course, i know there are other problems. I used to live in saudia for a short period before as a child and kids there would throw sand at my eyes, be verbally abusive or physically too.

Jews are the only indigenous group in palastine Isreal land,34,1bolkvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bolkvr/jews_are_the_only_indigenous_group_in_palastine/,34,1711492960.0,"I read this from zionists in here and other subs. One  of their key arguments is that Jews are the only indigenous group to Palastine. This is wrong in so many levels. Not only it is wrong because it is sneaky way to deny the Palastinan rights and a way to say that they are ""Arabs"" and arabs are conquers and thus we can move palastinans to other ""Arab"" countries. It is also wrong on ethinc and genetic level, in fact jews and palastinans are quite related, and infact it is quite  sneaky to put it in any other way. 

For example in the Science published paper: 
https://www.science.org/content/article/jews-and-arabs-share-recent-ancestry#:~:text=Clashing%20groups%20are%20Y%20chromosome%20cousins&text=More%20than%2070%25%20of%20Jewish,the%20last%20few%20thousand%20years.

""It says and I qoute: More than 70% of Jewish men and half of the Arab men whose DNA was studied inherited their Y chromosomes from the same paternal ancestors who lived in the region within the last few thousand years.

The results match historical accounts that some Moslem Arabs are descended from Christians and Jews who lived in the southern Levant, a region that includes Israel and the Sinai. They were descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times. And in a recent study of 1371 men from around the world, geneticist Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona in Tucson found that the Y chromosome in Middle Eastern Arabs was almost indistinguishable from that of Jews.""

Moreover, on the Pubmed published paper: 
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/
I qoute: ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites, who extensively mixed with Egyptians, Mesopotamian, and Anatolian peoples in ancient times. Thus, Palestinian-Jewish rivalry is based in cultural and religious, but not in genetic, differences. The relatively close relatedness of both Jews and Palestinians to western Mediterranean populations reflects the continuous circum-Mediterranean cultural and gene flow that have occurred in prehistoric and historic times."" 

And then they ll tell you that there is nothing called palastinans, and they are arab conqueres, and they are not related to the land, that they are just invisible and not there to start with, that the orginal Caanites have assimilated and they are no more, only jews there. But hey, Eurpean Ashkinazi Jews are pure bread and they are indigenous to this land whom they didnt live in for the last 2000 years. 

In fact, Ashkenazi Jewish share an even DNA between Middle Eastern and Europeans,, they are in fact half European, which is normal as they assimilated with where they lived with. I qoute this from Haartez which reference  another paper.I aoute ""In that research, which appeared in Nature Communications, a team led by Shai Carmi of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem sequenced the complete genomes of 128 people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Their analysis revealed that the Ashkenazi Jewish population is ‚Äúan even mix‚Äù of European and Middle Eastern ancestral populations""

The fact that lies are spread that European Jews have  the right to the land, when they have lived 2000 years abroad, became European by all means and measures, yet retain Jewish ancestry, but Palstianans  who are actually ancestors of the same people, share the same DNA to the jews, and have lived and continue to live since thousands of years do not have right is rewriting history, spreading hate and abhorrent lies. 

By denying Palstianan rights to this land, is to fornthe isrealis to deny their own jewish heritage in their palastinan brothers. Zionists use religion as the tool for division and to occupy the land (so much for the only democracy in the middle east, no less thanks to Bibi), it is not an ethnicity nor a problem of indigenous people, it is a pure balant apartheid and occupation. 

I finally qoute Amnesty: ""Our report reveals the true extent of Israel‚Äôs apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel‚Äôs cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid.

Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza,81,1bmgazq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bmgazq/are_we_eating_grass_to_survive_in_gaza/,8,1711270575.0,"People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here‚Äîsorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

Regarding this account, yes, I didn't create it; someone else did and used it to post a bit to gain some karma before I took over and discovered this community. This is where I feel most welcome on Reddit, and for that, I am deeply grateful. Thank you all for your support.

I never imagined I would reach a point where I'd have to beg for food to feed my family. You or your descendants could be next when imperialists decide they're interested in your country's land and resources. May Allah bless us all with success, health, happiness, patience, and strength.

But the truth is that the IOF are modern day Nazis. And what the new Nazis are doing in Gaza is, in fact, a holocaust. It can even be said that what is happening in Gaza now, is worse in terms of human suffering, than the holocaust in WWII.

&#x200B;

When I went to an American high school, a holocaust survivor came to speak at our school said that they went to an internment camp, but that they would often be taken to the beach and swim in the ocean by German soldiers. In contrast with Gaza, IOF have absolutely 0 kindness for their Palestinian hostages.

&#x200B;

Americans are taught heavily about the holocaust in high school, and there are usually holocaust survivors which speak at American high schools. Thus the phrase ""holocaust"" does have more mileage (more impact) than just calling it a ""genocide"" to a western audience.

Only when an external enemy props up (like Israel or in some cases countries in the west) do Muslims band together.



I myself am a pretty irreligious Muslim, - I don't espouse this ummah brotherhood myth- but I observe that you still have brown-nosing Muslims who sometimes will spite other muslims and curry favour non-muslims instead, in principle nothing wrong with this as some people will have friends from other backgrounds, but if brotherhood isn't a thing during the mundane times, what makes people think people will actually band together?

Look at every other muslim country and then tend to hate/dislike/have historical feud with their neighbouring muslim country, sometimes not even different countries but different regions or ethnic/cultural groups.

Happy Nowruz from Iran,95,1bleewy,https://i.redd.it/9s6hthpr6zpc1.jpeg,13,1711152452.0,"Nowruz is made by two words: Now (New) + Ruz (Day) which means new day, and it's celebrated in the first day of the spring, and lasts for 13 days. In the 13th day, it's traditional to go out with family and relatives, like a picnic, to see the nature and gather together to enjoy the new year.

The most simple way to celebrate Nowruz is Haftsin.

What is haftsin? It's made from Haft (Seven) + Sin (S) which means 7 things that start with an s.

1: Sabze. It's grass that you should water it and let it grow before Spring comes. Most people are lazy these days so we just buy it from flowershops.

2: Sumak (another kind of plant)

3: Sib (apple)

4: Sir (garlic)

5: Serkeh (vinegar)

6: Senjed (Oleaster fruit)

7: Samanu (a kind of pudding)

Some people add colored eggshells, sonbol (a kind of flower), sekkeh (coin) and Quran (or any holy book, my family isn't religious so we use Shahname, which is a Persian poem book), and a mirror. But the seven things that I already mentioned are the main ones that are supposed to represent life coming with spring. These things were added in time just to make the table prettier I guess.

Personally, I've lost my husband and countless loved ones to the relentless conflict that ravages our homeland. We've endured weeks of starvation, unable to afford even the most basic sustenance, and It's a painful reality to bear.

That being said, we cannot indulge in self pity. Our survival is measured in mere seconds and minutes, and I cannot envision a future beyond today. As terrible as it sounds, I often encounter people who are worse off than I am.

Here are some of the challenges we face on a daily basis: 

1. Fear and tension everywhere
2. Our children are dying of malnutrition and dehydration.
3. People being shot while queuing for aid.
4. Newborn babies crammed into incubators due to lack of space.
5. Lack of electricity leading to daily life ending at sunset.
6. Constant fear of Israeli bombs.
7. Sexual assault of our girls, women and men.
8. We live in makeshift structures, tents, or out in the open.
9. There‚Äôs a  sanitation crisis leading to health risks.
10. Food shortages and risk of famine, with 90% of the population facing acute levels of food insecurity.
11. Lack of clean drinking water.
12. Cases of diarrhoea increased to 40 times higher and more
13. Unknown diseases spreading rapidly
14. Destruction of hospitals by Israel's bombardment, leaving only 12 out of 36 hospitals partially functioning.
15. Postponement of ""normal"" surgical cases, leading to increased suffering and deaths.
16. Overcrowding in hospitals, with 77 newborns sharing just 20 incubators.
17. Intermittent internet and power blackouts.
18. Sense of isolation and anxiety among us.
19. Loss of sense of security and normalcy in daily life.
20. Death, destruction of infrastructure, and not even our dead are spared. We can't bury them, and those that are buried are exhumed.
21. Desperate search for hope and relief from daily hardships.

We desperately need a ceasefire now because I doubt we can endure much more. I hope and pray for a solution soon because what you're seeing on your TV networks, internet, and social media pales in comparison to the reality on the ground.",1711111016.0,AskMiddleEast

This post then seemed to embolden some Anti-Semitic commenters, who made some lazy generalisations of the Jewish community, and also ended up attracting some Zionist commenters who wanted to use this specific post (and the actual Anti-Semitic comments) as an opportunity to hate on Arabs, Islam, and Muslims generally.

As many already know (or should surely know by now), Zionists want people to continue conflating Zionism with Judaism so that they can, amongst other things, (1) falsely state that it is ‚ÄúAnti-Semitic‚Äù to criticise Israel and / or Zionists, and (2) have people believe Zionists = Jews and vice versa so that when people criticise Israel and / or Zionists, Israel sadistically uses this criticism to keep the memory of very real Jewish suffering alive and have Jews across the globe believe that Israel is Jews‚Äô only real ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù. 

Zionism is a political movement that emerged in the late 19th century. Judaism is around 4,000 years old. They are not one and the same.

Also, there are a number of regulars I‚Äôve often seen while scrolling through this sub., that are Jewish (according to their flairs) and often express Anti-Zionist views too. Jewish Anti-Zionists in particular tend to come to this sub. (and other Middle Eastern subs.) looking for community and belonging, so to my fellow Middle Easterns out there, we should not be alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters. 

And finally, as noted above, when we Arabs and / or Muslims conflate Zionism and Judaism, Zionists then end up chiming in. They love to turn moments like that into some kind of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù (to falsely spread the idea that Arabs and Muslims generally have some kind of innate hatred of Jews (which is far from true)).

Many people, especially those belonging to regional minorities, blame Arabisation over Islam, in a not-so-rare sight of complete ignorance in sighting Islam as a fascist/Arabist 'ideology'.

This map describes the rough borders of the region before Khalid Bin AlWaleed's campaign. Both Banu Lahm & Banu Ghassan were Christian Arab tribes who fought a proxy war on behalf of the Romans & the Persians.

Arabisation of the souther Levant & Iraq provinces was not done by Islam. It was in fact, I argue, made more feasible by the Roman/Persian centuries-long conflict and their use of Christian Arab tribes in their proxy wars (something Israel does today targetting Christians, Kurds and other groups with their propaganda).

I don't understand why they hate Arabisation so much, when Persianisation/Romanisation is ok for them. Is it just an issue of religion? Or ignorance? I put my money on ignorance.

If anything, Romans Romanised and Persians Persianised, and both Arabised, the region.",1711099198.0,AskMiddleEast

All my Palestinians friends are from the diaspora or West Bank. And maybe I'm in a bubble but I feel like I haven't heard the voice for those that grew up in Israel. If we there is a chance for a solution, whether one or two state, I feel like their perspective is critical. We can know all the history and facts, but understanding the reality and identity of the 48 Palestinians might be a building block for the bridge for a solution. I try to keep an open mind and allow space for alternative perspectives. At any rate, I don't want to speak for them. I want to hear from them. 

So this popped up on my YouTube. I have never heard of her before. I watched the whole interview. I was floored by her words. I am trying not to judge or psychoanalyze, but it's hard to not link her childhood trauma in Gaza with what appears to me as hatred for the Palestinians in Gaza or WB. Denying apartheid but accepting theres racism in Israel simply basing it off her lived experience. She might be an extreme case and maybe thats why she was cherry picked by Bari Weiss for the interview. 

Anyway I'm trying not to put too much of my own analysis on it without hearing from Palestinians from any part of the world but especially '48 Palestinians.

I have also been watching a few of these [videos](https://youtu.be/M3wu2d5RnaE?si=0RyltDjlM7OfkPbR).

I obviously recognize that they may not be able to speak as freely as they would want and it irritates me that the YouTuber is trying to coerce an answer out of them that he wants to hear (that they are indeed different than Palestinians in WB or Gaza). But it was interesting to watch nonetheless getting insight from their perspective. 

Anyway I am hoping to have a good dialogue about this. ",1711050514.0,AskMiddleEast

1 - What do you think he will do with Israel? Are we going to war? 

2 - We have a sectarian problem. Will he choose one sect of Islam and history say it's the truth and eradicate all other sects? Will you be okay with that? What about different religions in the Middle East?

3 - There is an ethnic problem in the Middle East. How will he unite all these ethnicities and languages? Are we going to have one official language or multiple? What will he do with different cultures? Will there be federalism?

4 - There are tons of Muslim countries outside the Middle East and a lot of Muslims live in secular countries like Russia, India, and China. Will he try to separate them? Will he go to war to free them? 

5 - What about countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan? Will secular Muslim-majority countries be forced to join?

\- Netanyahu takes advantage of that support to destroy Gaza and annex as much land as possible.

\- A few thousand Americans will withdraw their support for Biden, which could be enough for Trump to win the election. After all, it would be challenging to convince individuals who lost 80 family members in Gaza that Biden is still a better choice than Trump!

\- Upon Trump's winning, Netanyahu immediately ends the military phase of the operation.

\- Trump takes credit for ending the war, convincing Americans that Netanyahu remains the best choice for Israel and highlighting his ability to collaborate with him.

\- Netanyahu convinces Israelis that he knows how to deal with Trump, reminding them of his achievements during Trump's first term.

\- Netanyahu's political future, seemingly doomed based on the Biden administration, is suddenly revitalized.

\- Trump resumes where he left off at the end of his first term, taking advantage of the realities on the ground at the end of the Gaza war, to broker deals with corrupt Middle Eastern leaders on behalf of Israel.

\- The precise outcome for Gaza and the West Bank remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: this situation will be the final nail on the two-state coffine, a result Netanyahu has always desired, eliminating any lingering hope for a sovereign Palestinian state.

One could argue that Netanyahu planned all these events, effectively manipulating the Biden admin and by extension the US. Regardless, one thing is certain: the Biden admin will face significant embarrassment for losing the election due to its support of a genocide!",1710991584.0,AskMiddleEast

The situation both political and social are deteriorating for Muslims with the constant abuse, anti-Islam, Anti-Muslim, and Islamophobic comments and ideas coming from both sides of the political establishment. With the recent ""uncommited"" vote, Muslims saw Democrats as unhinged, blue MAGA, style people who would wish to see us in camps and do not care about the thousands upon thousands of innocent Muslim and Christian Gazan babies dying in an unjust and genocidal war. The other side is just as unhinged as the blue side.

In Europe it is nothing less than a full blown Islamophobic craze with Germany drinking deeply of the crazy kool-aid against Muslims and Palestinians and the rest of the ""western"" world falling into line with this thought.

How long will it be until these crazed countries start braying for the blood of Muslims?  Is it not time for us Muslims to understand that there is no life in these lands and until they become sane it is far better to return to our original countries, if we can, or to other Muslim countries and help develop them and grow instead of living in fear of the progrom that may come?

Why hasn't Saudi Arabia or Turkey developed nuclear weapons yet? Will they in the future?,6,1bi0j2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bi0j2o/why_hasnt_saudi_arabia_or_turkey_developed/,31,1710792624.0,"Like the title says. 

Developing nuclear weapons is not very complicated or very expensive. 

Political scientists like William Spaniel estimate that roughly 70 countries have the capacity to develop them, but that it's ultimately a political decision. And yet, only 9 have them today. 

Both Turkey and Saudi have had the ability to develop them for quite some time now. So I wanted to ask, why do Turkey and Saudi Arabia not develop nukes?

Is it fear of economic sanctions? Can someone please explain? 

I know that nukes aren't the end all be all, but in a situation like there is now, having them means you can't be held hostage militarily. You now have a deterrent, and that gives you more options to act, and any retaliation will be limited, so as to not provoke use of nukes. 

Even poor DPRK no longer has to fear a second g9nocide, because Kim Jong Un has the red button now.

I am Christian Arab, however, I don‚Äôt have any Christian Arabs around me in my city in the state I reside in. I have friends that are Christian Arabs and they have family stuck in Gaza.

Although I am Arab, I didn‚Äôt grow up with the exact values of the culture therefore I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone of the Muslim faith by calling a mosque and asking if they‚Äôd be willing to donate.

By 1920 Britain had occupied Palestine and set up a League of Nations mandate named Mandatory Palestine, which lasted until its termination in 1948. The caricature shows how Britain as the occupying power facilitated the Zionist movement‚Äôs project in Palestine 1920-1948. Namely Britain allowing unrestricted Jewish immigration from Europe threatened the demographic Arab majority and thus they rose in rebellion to demand Palestinian Arab independence during the 1936 revolt, which coincided with the period when this caricature was published.

Top left counterclockwise descriptions: Naharayim electric power station built by Russian Zionist pioneer Rutenerg at the confluence of the Yarmouk and Jordan rivers who was given a British concession; similar project by a Zionist figure for production of salts from the Dead Sea; dispossession of Arab peasants due to Jewish land purchases from wealthy landowners; inter-Palestinian Arab aristocratic bickering in a self-criticism towards Palestinian leadership; European Jewish immigration to Palestine; British self-termed improvement municipal works which were viewed by Arabs as facilitating Jewish takeover; Jewish factories opened by the Zionist immigrants; and finally the colonization of land.

CAIR-LA Receives Reports of FBI Targeting Palestinians for Questioning About Israeli War on Gaza,11,1bheqpn,https://ca.cair.com/losangeles/news/cair-la-receives-reports-of-fbi-targeting-palestinians-for-questioning-about-israeli-war-on-gaza/,0,1710725245.0,"(LOS ANGELES, CA ‚Äì 3/7/2024) ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Greater Los Angeles Area office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) has received multiple complaints from members of the Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim communities in Southern California who report that FBI agents have targeted them about matters related to the Israeli war on Gaza. 

Federal and local law enforcement agents have allegedly approached community members, asking questions about whether they support or would offer support to Hamas, whether they support the use of violence in the region, and what their opinions are on Israel and Hamas. 

In a statement, CAIR-LA Civil Rights Managing Attorney Dina Chehata, Esq. said: 

‚ÄúWe are particularly concerned about the FBI questioning our community, given the FBI‚Äôs long-standing history of abusive surveillance. When it comes to American Muslims and other vulnerable communities, we know that federal agents often investigate individuals on the basis of their racial, ethnic, or religious characteristics rather than their actual propensity to commit a crime.  

‚ÄúThis can and has had serious consequences for our community, and we have seen the devastating impact of these practices on American Muslims in Southern California.  

‚ÄúIn the current climate, where pro-Palestinian advocacy is being penalized and heavily censored, we have profound concerns that it is also being criminalized. For that reason, we want people to exercise the utmost caution when talking to federal or local agents, and ideally, don‚Äôt do it without consulting an attorney.‚Äù

Federal law criminalizes providing material support to any group designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department, including financial support, food, clothing, and other humanitarian aid. Any questions posed by federal or local authorities on this matter, or any other, should be directed to and reviewed by an attorney.  

CAIR-LA strongly recommends that community members do not speak to federal agents or local officers without the presence of counsel and urges the community to learn their rights when speaking with law enforcement.  

If you are being contacted by federal or local authorities for voluntary questioning, please reach out immediately to CAIR-LA‚Äôs Civil Rights Department at (714) 776-1177.

There are so many parallels, all the way down to the banning of wearing religious ornaments in government positions. Concurrently there was a massive push to Westernize while preserving the bare essentials of traditional Islamic values, while not allowing Islam to govern day-to-day life the way it did in Saudi Arabia, for instance.

Why did such a secularist movement not take off in the Arab world in the same way? It seems that at best, the most ""secular"" Arab countries were primarily dictatorships. Ba'athists in Iraq and Syria seemed more focused on ""Arab culture"" than on Islam per se, but their brand of authoritarianism was a far cry from the more liberal democracy that Kemalist doctrine pushed for.

I've noticed a rising tide of posts and comments that criticize Arab leaders, particularly for their perceived lack of action or vocal support concerning the issue of Palestine. However, I would like to take a moment to ask everyone to exercise patience and understanding towards these leaders.

To provide some context, I come from a family with strong social connections. When we were approached by a BJP leader for an outreach program related to the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act - a law in India that has been criticized as anti-Muslim), many Muslim leaders and imams declined to engage. However, our family chose to welcome the BJP leader into our home and engage in a dialogue about the controversial law. We took this opportunity to express our concerns about the law and presented a document outlining the community's issues. Despite being labelled as 'traitors' by some, we believe that dialogue is the first step towards resolution. 

Drawing parallels with the Arab leaders, they cannot effectively employ diplomacy, negotiation, or mediation if their initial approach is one of hostility. Diplomacy is a delicate dance of drawing and redrawing positions, and I am confident that there are numerous actions taking place behind the scenes to foster peace. However, these actions cannot be effectively executed through media statements or antagonistic tactics.

Moreover, these leaders often face criticism for their handling of refugees. The reality is that relocating refugees to places like the Sinai Peninsula could potentially make it the next target for illegal settlements. If they concede even an inch, the fear is that a mile will be taken in return.

Therefore, I urge you to show patience towards these leaders. Trust in their intentions to do what is best for their citizens and the Muslim community at large, to the best of their abilities. Let's hope and pray that they are guided to make the right decisions based on their understanding.",1712648591.0,AskMiddleEast

Serious discussion: Why isn't anyone talking about the hundreds of Israeli security forces Hamas eliminated on October 7th? Official estimates based on the Israel social security data point out that at least 370 Israeli security forces were eliminated on October 7th.,37,1bzde7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMiddleEast/comments/1bzde7q/serious_discussion_why_isnt_anyone_talking_about/,21,1712619873.0,"Why is this fact always ignored by the media? Shortly after October 7th the media was sooooo eager to relay propaganda about 40 beheaded babies etc. Yet two months later (Dec 2023) When Official data was released the media just stopped going into detail, yet hasn't changed the narrative about October 7th.

khamas is supposedly the brutal party here, yet less than 4% of the Israeli casualties on October 7th (36 lives) were under 18 years of age. Less than 2% (20 lives) were under 15 years of age. 

On the other hand, AT LEAST 40% of the Palestinian casualties are children. A child is killed on average every 10 minutes in Gaza, says WHO chief. And that's the ""most moral army in the world"" mind you.

I wonder why I have the feeling that Hamas doesn't put on table direct negotiations for an exhaustive solution to the conflict , with an objective to pave the way for a two state solution. Now the world has turned its attention to the region finally , and this will never last. As soon as the war ends , the problem will be forgotten again and palestinians will get back to the sidelines. Thus I dont thing the ""stages policy"" would be effective in this case. I felt that this war could be a support to expose to the world the dilemma and put pressure on Israel towards the two state solution. But I am shocked this is not mentionned by Hamas !

I note that Islamic civilization is based on Islam while Western civilization is broader than Christianity.  So will there still be solidarity between people of Islamic origin after secularization?  I had difficulty seeing the survival of an Islamic civilization after profound secularization.  We notice a very strong decline in Islam in Iran and Turkey, the Arab countries are more attached to Islam, but I am not convinced that this will last, the Western way of life seems to be spreading to the Maghreb, to Saudi Arabia.

Now, it is made open that Israel also has strict censorship and this terrorist regime is intentionally assassinating journalists. Then the US is also closing pro-Palestine accounts on YouTube and even preparing a new law to steal TikTok. For decades, the Western propaganda machine had successfully demonstrated Palestinians as stupid, ungrateful, and bloodthirsty mobs.

While I agree that all repressed people should have their right to struggle, supporting Palestine had become the most politically correct thing in ME, and Iran is doing the best at this moment. Although some people may argue that Iran is sacrificing Palestinians for its own ambition, the truth is not only Israel but also the entire West didn't want to give Palestine a chance to exist. Before Israel was forced to reveal its true face, there used to be more idiots in the West believing that Israel is a moral country. Hamas tried to struggle diplomatically by quiting 2006 presidential election but only compete in legislative election, to form a government that the West would accept. They also sided with Syrian rebellion forces and turned against Iran and Hezbollah, but none of these changed their situation.

From Iran's perspective, Syria is too strategically important to lose, and it had to destroy that revolution to ensure future plan. I can't say it is ethical to help Palestine at the cost of Syrian people's life, but Iran is the only country that possible of ending Western colonialism in Middle East so far. However, even after Iran suceed, there is no guareente that it won't become the second antagonists. At this moment, I can only say that Yemenis are better off without Saudi Arabia founding terrorists and causing civil war, and Soouthern Lebanese can live free from Israel's colonialism.

  
Here I just want to list some simple facts about in Iran before and after Islamic revolution, so that royalists and biased people can understand modernization is more than fancy hotel and bikini.

1.The life expectancy of Iranians was around 50 when Shah was still the emperor. Allowing you to do drug and orgy in top class hotel doesn't mean your country automatically get better.

2. Shah consipred with CIA to overthrow prime minister Mossadegh who tried to nationalize oil recources, then Shah himself also lost America's support joining Arab nations to cut oil production.

3.Iran didn't have a sophisticated industrial before Shah left, and couldn't repare any military veichles imported from America during Iran & Iraq war.

4.Shah also fund proxies in ME but generally for short term benefit instead of building them into strong ally and always betray them right after he gets what he want, such as the Kurds in Iraq.",1712461403.0,AskMiddleEast

There‚Äôve been several conflicts spanning generations and sides have been extremely ruthless and barbaric, for example, the Quraish against Muhammad and early day Muslims, Pakistan army against Bengal civilians, 2002 Indian Gujarat massacre, Genghiz Khan‚Äôs atrocities, Russian aggression against Ukraine etc.

However, despite all the barbarism none or hardly any of the enemies of a state committed crimes that were so vile and simply psychopathic as Israelis against Palestinians. 

Everyday I read about IOF soldiers literally mocking deaths of babies, telegram posts about how good it feels to see babies being burnt alive, aid workers specifically targeted or how fun it is to turn children into orphans. There‚Äôre clips, and posts on TikTok and other platforms where Israeli civilians mock the deaths of Gazans and all call for execution of children and kids (aside from adults) just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfun‚Äù.

""Russia is also interested in exploiting the propaganda potential of US failure in Afghanistan, the Kremlin's initial reaction what the US lost and therefore Russia won.""

""However, Russia will probably try to use Afghanistan for 'selective engagement' to pursue a normalization of relations with the West on its own terms, and/or to use the enticement of Russian-EU cooperation on Afghanistan to order to undermine EU positions or achieve concessions on the sanctions put in place in response to Russian violations of the European security order.""

If this analysis is true, it sheds light on what is looking like a semi-convincing but ultimately fake resign by Harry to infest and infiltrate the US from sheer narcissistic rage to create ties to leech of taxpayer funds as their ""king"". LMFAO, we kicked out the landed gentry years ago because their law didn't check out and collapsed from analytical insecurity like inches into the miles American law can go. They'll probably try to blame Russia for it to when it looks like an active assassination machine developed by Russia was actively hired and recruited by the British monarchy, which was their choice, and their choice alone. They keep trying to blame everyone else for their mistakes but in the end they're analytically frail and in narcissistic rage about next to everyone around them (a trait Russia shares, at least under Putin). It would be pathetic if the UK tried to go to war with the US because they were now trying to rely on the US for funds after their completely idiot Brexit flop and couldn't take him being removed as it looks like he might be ensuring the leeching by analytically vain but analytically very unskilled people in the Hollywood area. I would say just ignore them; without the US they're screwed and Russia is literally only using them for their cash cow status. It might mean the end of the monarchy immediately on behalf of the EU if they're that hotheaded to try, which would be nice. I wouldn't care about their monarchy if they weren't so hotheaded, vain and incompetent enough to sign off on Brexit and then come crying to the US because their racism collapsed their economy while scapegoating each other for their own dumbassery and showing the weakest ties known to man.

Evidence for/against this analysis requested.

"This is the land that was promised to Arabs after WW1, instead Britain and France took it for themselves",426,1bwuil0,https://i.redd.it/91k9l8q4hqsc1.jpeg,275,1712354517.0,"
During WW1 the British feared the Ottoman Empire so much they promised to grant Arabs independence in exchange for revolting against them

But instead of following through with their promise, the Europeans made a secret deal to split up the Ottoman's territory amongst themselves. 

At the end of the war Britain signed the Balfour Declaration, giving its support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" to the horror of the Arab world who had been promised that very land.

They never intended to keep their promise to us, instead exploiting us to weaken our own people and bring down their biggest enemy in the Middle East.

The West's involvement in the Middle East has only gotten worse since then. When the Arab Coalition went to war against Israel to rightfully reclaim the land promised to them, the Americans funded Israel's military and convinced the British to support Israel over their Egyptian allies. Once again the West had fucked over Arabs.

The current genocide in Gaza is because of Western nations. They are the ones who started this conflict when they made a promise they couldn't keep. 

And now here we are almost a century later with American-made bombs killing tens of thousands of innocent civilians in Palestine...",1712354517.0,AskMiddleEast

I am a non-arab Muslim getting married to a Palestinian woman soon. I have a bunch of questions about basic Palestinian wedding etiquette that I'd love to know. I know some things, but I want to know all of what will be expected from me on my wedding day. Ill give some background of how we intend to do our wedding. We intend to have it split between two days, katb kitab in the masjid, and the second day will be a smaller party in a banquet hall dinner of about 100 people (it was really hard to limit it to be this small but it's what we wanted). I would love to know even the smallest basic etiquette, both cultural and non cultural, that I should have when going to the wedding, what's expected of me, and what do I bring. I know I have to bring flowers, but how many? Do I get some for her whole family? Do I need to say something in particular to her parents? Her mom? Her family members? What kind of mannerisms should I exhibit? Any kind of dance moves I should learn outside of Dabke? Every little etiquette you can think of, I would love to know. I'm a blank slate and need to learn everything! No advice will be useless.

*M. Jalal Hashim*
Juba - 5 April 2024

There is a given rule that solution is unfathomable for a problem that is unfathomable as well. To bring peace to any war, one must first and above all understand the nature of the particular war targeted for a solution. So, no way for any peaceful solution in this ongoing war in the Sudan unless its nature is understood. 

Another rule is that if the nature of any war proves to be 100% eliminatory, then reaching a peaceful compromise is the job of either the gods or demons, but not humans. The nature of the ongoing war in the Sudan has clearly shown that it is either the Order of State will prevail, or the Disorder of Statelessness. The RSF Janjaweed militias have made the war so when they committed- and are still committing crimes of war against ordinary civilians. If the RSF Janjaweed militias decide to resort to the state of Order of State, they will have to face the warranted wrath of the masses of people in streets and courts. Amnesty, compared to the nature and volume of the crimes committed, is beyond the capacity of any national, regional or international authority. So, any peaceful settlement to the ongoing war in the Sudan will practically bring the RSF Janjaweed militias, fighters, ringleaders and topleaders, as well as their rank and file among politicians and collaborators, to their day of reckoning to face the wrath of the masses of victims in both streets and courts. If justice is not squarely done, public unrest, destabilization and disorder are eminent. Any mediation mechanism that does not bear this in their mind either they are totally incompetent, or they intentionally work to push things into this bottomless abyss of chaos. In both cases the result will be the same: the destruction of the Nation Statehood of the Sudan and Sudanese people. Such an intervention is nothing but the completion and finishing of the project the RSF Janjaweed militias have tried to do: the liquidation of the institution of the Nation Statehood.

*Conclusion*: Beware of any mechanism of mediation that aims to rewind history to the status quo before the war. This will do nothing other than reinforce RSF Janjaweed militias to come back to war much more powerful militarily and politically than when they began it. This time, they will come to war with fully potent stamina so as to finish their job of destruction neat and clean.

So, the keyword for understanding the nature of this war is to have a clear vision, answer, and stance for the following question: what will become of the RSF Janjaweed militias? 

The war launched by the RSF Janjaweed militias is clearly now against the masses of ordinary and civilian Sudanese people, not against the Sudanese army in anyway. The role of the Sudanese army here, with all said about how weakened it is by the notorious Islamist regime, is that it is the only military force the Sudanese people have got at their disposal. Those who look at the parties of the war to be the RSF Janjaweed militias on one side and the Sudanese army on the other are either the victims of a completely distorted image, or they themselves are trying to distort the image intentionally.
