Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

Anyway, I went ahead and invited three of our more active and civil users to join the moderating team. Hopefully this will help refresh and improve the subreddit. If you ever need to get a hold of me, the best way to do so is to message me on Twitter: FreeSyrianMemes

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

More than 36 hours after the earthquake buried their family as they slept, two toddlers caught between concrete in the ruins of their home in northern Syria have been freed.

The older youngster can be heard on film pleading with rescuers as they stand amid the ruins of the children's house in Besnaya-Bseineh, ""Get me out of here, I'll do anything for you.""

She continues, ""I'll be your servant,"" to the rescuer's ""No, no.""

They are huddled together in what might be the ruins of their bed, and the girl, Mariam, softly touches the hair on the head of her younger sibling. She is able to move her arm just far enough to shield her sibling's face from the debris and dust.",1676023714.0,SyrianRebels

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use. 

And no, im not trying to go on some anti turkish rant, but this is infuriating. Not simply because of Zenkis record but this crook getting special treatment while Syrians get deported over Bananna jokes.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

Gazans' share their thoughts on Hamas-Assad restoring ties,7,xirgdx,https://english.alaraby.co.uk/news/hamas-renewal-ties-syria-divides-gazans,0,1663627974.0,"> ""I cannot understand how Hamas can reconcile with Bashar al-Assad, who committed crimes against humanity no less than what Israel did against our people in Gaza and the West Bank,"" said one Palestinian in Gaza


> Ibrahim al-Shanti, a resident of Gaza City, told The New Arab: ""At a time when Hamas accepted to restore its relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who killed dozens of thousands of his people, what prevents it from restoring its relations with the Palestinian Authority, which did not commit such crimes,""


> Samia Al-Agbar, another Gaza-based resident, said to The New Arab, ""I cannot understand how Hamas can reconcile with Bashar al-Assad, who committed crimes against humanity no less than what Israel did against our people in Gaza and the West Bank. There is no doubt that the Assad regime is criminal and murderous, who caused the destruction of Syria and the displacement of millions of defenceless civilians,"" she added. ""Hamas has lost a lot of its popularity because of this irresponsible step.""


> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal. I think that the Palestinian people will not forgive the resistance movement (Hamas) on such a decision, especially since Assad's crimes are no less cruel than those committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians,""


> Ismail Atallah, from Gaza City, argues ""Hamas is an essential part of the resistance axis, which includes Syria and Iran (...) The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever.

> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support. Hamas suffers from political isolation at the Arab level, especially in light of Arab-Israeli normalisation and the return of relations between Turkey and Israel. It had to make its final decision between remaining alone in the confrontation or returning to the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah,""",1663627974.0,SyrianRebels

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

To those of you well intentioned, well meaning Kurds whom yearn to spend centuries more with their ""Arab"" brothers and otherwise, we hope to one day rebuild our nation amongst each other.

Not under the banner of ethnicity, nor the banner of self destructive ideologies pertaining to specific individuals and their convictions, but under the banner of cooperation, civil discourse and security.

I hope to one day see thriving Arab and Kurdish communities and for those of you whom do not wish for such a thing, may you be forsaken from attaining your perilous dreams.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

The econonomics of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,3,r922l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/r922l0/the_econonomics_of_hayat_tahrir_alsham/,0,1638660540.0,"[https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham](https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham)

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

What the Azm Operations Room can learn from HTS,6,qrrrjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrrrjl/what_the_azm_operations_room_can_learn_from_hts/,3,1636655690.0,"Though the claim ""HTS is a rebranding of Nusra"" is partially true, it is not the full truth. HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

ALERT: demographic threat to local Syrians,15,qrl7h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrl7h4/alert_demographic_threat_to_local_syrians/,7,1636636954.0,"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.middleeastmonitor.com/20211025-iran-establishes-new-brigade-in-eastern-syria-composed-of-local-shia-converts/amp/

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today. Give it 5 years it will be even worse. The end result will cause an eternal sectarian war in the region if this isnt halted",1636636954.0,SyrianRebels
Ibrahim Bin Masud is not who he seems,3,qrhlc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrhlc3/ibrahim_bin_masud_is_not_who_he_seems/,0,1636623261.0,"Now why am I making this post? Because I believe in transparency. Regardless of ones faction, fooling the public is a tactic I think we should avoid in general.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels
My crack at an essay on the Popular Resistance Companies,3,qrfbnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrfbnf/my_crack_at_an_essay_on_the_popular_resistance/,3,1636613750.0,"Now one would be tempted to call them an ""HTS component."" There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here. 

Now even the logo itself screams ""NDF.""

[It is literally an \\""islamified\\"" NDF logo lol](https://preview.redd.it/1au456tiwwy71.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4675a4b73c5c55a6584045d3b1e19218c8a5fd1d)

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant. 

Though HTS itself has now embraced the green flag: [https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864](https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864) (evidence) the Popular Resistance in particular waves it at most of its functions in general always embraces it [https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron\_10/status/1372240471368548352](https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron_10/status/1372240471368548352) (evidence)

SDF Yellow Shabiha files: Abu Khawla,5,qre8jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qre8jx/sdf_yellow_shabiha_files_abu_khawla/,7,1636609764.0,"FYI: I call PYD affiliated people ""Yellow Shabiha."" Don't twist it lol.

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

[This insect is pretty bad, even by Assadist standards](https://preview.redd.it/2xvl19gx8gy71.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=51204a8ec425f658ad18600639be6866d8728852)

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

Ibrahim Bin Masud, who I normally highly respect, made an extremely wrongheaded statement.

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

A go to (supposed) rebuttal of theirs is that all Arabs are mercenaries and only their cause is legitimate, which only further lessens their legitimacy (including the legitimacy to continuously arm themselves).

Then the army officers stabbed each other in the back until Col Shishakli ruled the roost. He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive.

Abu Amshas recent statements,9,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

Azm Operations Room,5,p9gqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/p9gqnr/azm_operations_room/,2,1629653308.0,"Okay, after not being on reddti for a bit, I am suprised no one is talking about the Azm Operations Room.

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

I'm genuinely curious to know just exactly to what leading authority the region will answer to, potentially in place of all the idiots governing it. Whether we speak of the existing territories that belong to the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria and as well as Iraq (whom her people are yet to see the sheer idiocy of having removed Saddam).

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

Thanks for keeping the subreddit alive despite the mostly inactive moderating team. Reddit has changed a lot since I created it many years ago. I still find myself prefixing my urls with old.reddit because I don’t understand how to use new Reddit, and I’m sure I’m missing a lot of messages, chats, modmail, etc.

Anyway, I went ahead and invited three of our more active and civil users to join the moderating team. Hopefully this will help refresh and improve the subreddit. If you ever need to get a hold of me, the best way to do so is to message me on Twitter: FreeSyrianMemes

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

What soured the relations between Saudi Arabia and the Syrian rebels?

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

I say I don't know much so don't be too harsh. Thank you for reading",1673663598.0,SyrianRebels

Today marks the 11th anniversary of Mashaal Tammo's death days after being threatened by the PYD.

Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

There is no doubt that the Assad regime is criminal and murderous, who caused the destruction of Syria and the displacement of millions of defenceless civilians,"" she added. ""Hamas has lost a lot of its popularity because of this irresponsible step.""


> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal. I think that the Palestinian people will not forgive the resistance movement (Hamas) on such a decision, especially since Assad's crimes are no less cruel than those committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians,""

The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever. I think that Hamas took this decision to emphasise its connection with the Arab world, especially after Turkey, which hosts the majority of the movement's leaders, announced the restoration of its relations with Israel,""


> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support. Hamas suffers from political isolation at the Arab level, especially in light of Arab-Israeli normalisation and the return of relations between Turkey and Israel.

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today. Give it 5 years it will be even worse. The end result will cause an eternal sectarian war in the region if this isnt halted",1636636954.0,SyrianRebels
Ibrahim Bin Masud is not who he seems,3,qrhlc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrhlc3/ibrahim_bin_masud_is_not_who_he_seems/,0,1636623261.0,"Now why am I making this post? Because I believe in transparency. Regardless of ones faction, fooling the public is a tactic I think we should avoid in general.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels
My crack at an essay on the Popular Resistance Companies,3,qrfbnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrfbnf/my_crack_at_an_essay_on_the_popular_resistance/,3,1636613750.0,"Now one would be tempted to call them an ""HTS component."" There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here. 

Now even the logo itself screams ""NDF.""

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant. 

Though HTS itself has now embraced the green flag: [https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864](https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864) (evidence) the Popular Resistance in particular waves it at most of its functions in general always embraces it [https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron\_10/status/1372240471368548352](https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron_10/status/1372240471368548352) (evidence)

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

[This insect is pretty bad, even by Assadist standards](https://preview.redd.it/2xvl19gx8gy71.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=51204a8ec425f658ad18600639be6866d8728852)

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

Ibrahim Bin Masud, who I normally highly respect, made an extremely wrongheaded statement.

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

They are ""Hazimis,"" in essence, too radical even for Daesh, their Takfir extending to those who dont pledge loyalty to them (much like the GIA did with the entire population of Algeria in the 90s)

Now I think the reason for their success is they are only made up of fanatics. They dont really control territory so anyone in the group joined voluntarily, and these are too extreme for Daesh keep in mind.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

They are a thorn in our sides and the more they attempt to make it clear to us that they've genuine claims, the less substantiated their presence becomes (specifically where it concerns the co-operation between the Kurds and Russia) on Syrian soil (particularly those not even from there).

A go to (supposed) rebuttal of theirs is that all Arabs are mercenaries and only their cause is legitimate, which only further lessens their legitimacy (including the legitimacy to continuously arm themselves).

I'm convinced that their supposed cause will continue to fall upon deaf ears and the recent declaration of persona non grata of some 10 ambassadors from Turkey is proof that Erdogan has a leg to stand on.",1635110452.0,SyrianRebels

Then the army officers stabbed each other in the back until Col Shishakli ruled the roost. He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive. 

If one has seen my past posts I dont think neither government is ideal; but I also prefer greater unity.

Abu Amshas recent statements,8,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

Azm Operations Room,5,p9gqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/p9gqnr/azm_operations_room/,2,1629653308.0,"Okay, after not being on reddti for a bit, I am suprised no one is talking about the Azm Operations Room.

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

The entire region is a sham and it seems to me like the will of the people is constantly and continuously crushed. To what end do you all believe? I'm genuinely curious to know just exactly to what leading authority the region will answer to, potentially in place of all the idiots governing it. Whether we speak of the existing territories that belong to the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria and as well as Iraq (whom her people are yet to see the sheer idiocy of having removed Saddam). 

I ask, because as a Westerner living in the West, I hate researching my region. There's never any good news.

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

Thanks for keeping the subreddit alive despite the mostly inactive moderating team. Reddit has changed a lot since I created it many years ago. I still find myself prefixing my urls with old.reddit because I don’t understand how to use new Reddit, and I’m sure I’m missing a lot of messages, chats, modmail, etc.

Anyway, I went ahead and invited three of our more active and civil users to join the moderating team. Hopefully this will help refresh and improve the subreddit. If you ever need to get a hold of me, the best way to do so is to message me on Twitter: FreeSyrianMemes

And of course, thanks to the new (and the old but still occasionally active) moderators for helping out.",1702355005.0,SyrianRebels

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

As every news outlet talking about Syria says, Assad is meeting with Saudi officials, who are even discussing about reintegrating his regime into the Arab League. How did this come to pass, given that in 2012, Saudi Arabia expelled Syria from the Arab League, giving its seat to the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces and calling it the ""sole legitimate representative of Syria""? What soured the relations between Saudi Arabia and the Syrian rebels? I figured this would be the right place to ask since I support the FSA and the only other Syrian subreddits I know of are r/Syria which doesn't seem to be too political and r/SyrianCirclejerkWar which.....no, just no.

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Today marks the 11th anniversary of Mashaal Tammo's death days after being threatened by the PYD. He was one of the most prominent Kurdish figures who supported the Syrian revolution.,5,xy08bu,https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschaal_Tammo,0,1665152003.0,"Conveniently, English, Arabic, and Kurdish language wiki pages leave out the specific details. Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

Particularly comparing the regime with Nazi Germany, which will have a strong effect. Most elements of German society have a strong sense of shame regarding that regime.

It is nice to see Syrian refugees taking the time to educate Germans about this still existing regime of horror.

Remember, educating people about the true horrors is important because the Assad regime is NOT simply your typical tinpot dictatorship, it is a systematic machine of exterminating any opposition.

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

What the Azm Operations Room can learn from HTS,7,qrrrjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrrrjl/what_the_azm_operations_room_can_learn_from_hts/,3,1636655690.0,"Though the claim ""HTS is a rebranding of Nusra"" is partially true, it is not the full truth. HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today.

Because I believe in transparency. Regardless of ones faction, fooling the public is a tactic I think we should avoid in general.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels

There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here.

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist.

Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

[This insect is pretty bad, even by Assadist standards](https://preview.redd.it/2xvl19gx8gy71.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=51204a8ec425f658ad18600639be6866d8728852)

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

I mention this, because living here in the West, many seem to think that Arabs (specifically Arabs) are dying to live amongst Westerners, which couldn't be farther from the truth. It's terrible listening to people say that they've not the right to seek refuge (whether temporary or long term) from a brutal dictatorship, even when they espouse that they themselves endured similar conditions not long ago (think Poland and the Baltics).

It is almost as though Syrians are to be told to suffer under this regime of theirs (obviously remaining in power by the will of external contributors) or quite literally die.

Ibrahim Bin Masud, who I normally highly respect, made an extremely wrongheaded statement.

[https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737](https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737)

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Then the army officers stabbed each other in the back until Col Shishakli ruled the roost. He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive. 

If one has seen my past posts I dont think neither government is ideal; but I also prefer greater unity. Warlordism and conflicting egos and financial interests has been a curse for the revolutionary cause historically.

Abu Amshas recent statements,10,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

More than 36 hours after the earthquake buried their family as they slept, two toddlers caught between concrete in the ruins of their home in northern Syria have been freed.

The older youngster can be heard on film pleading with rescuers as they stand amid the ruins of the children's house in Besnaya-Bseineh, ""Get me out of here, I'll do anything for you.""

She continues, ""I'll be your servant,"" to the rescuer's ""No, no.""

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Today marks the 11th anniversary of Mashaal Tammo's death days after being threatened by the PYD. He was one of the most prominent Kurdish figures who supported the Syrian revolution.,9,xy08bu,https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschaal_Tammo,0,1665152003.0,"Conveniently, English, Arabic, and Kurdish language wiki pages leave out the specific details. Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

I share this because if he uses likely looted wealth to reconsitute Zenki in the same style Jaish al-Islam was, we should immedietely call that out given his record.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use. 

And no, im not trying to go on some anti turkish rant, but this is infuriating. Not simply because of Zenkis record but this crook getting special treatment while Syrians get deported over Bananna jokes.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

""Hamas has lost a lot of its popularity because of this irresponsible step.""


> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal.

The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever.

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

The econonomics of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,3,r922l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/r922l0/the_econonomics_of_hayat_tahrir_alsham/,0,1638660540.0,"[https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham](https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham)

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

It is nice to see Syrian refugees taking the time to educate Germans about this still existing regime of horror.

Fixing what is happening in Syrian Interim Government,5,qxj6zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qxj6zg/fixing_what_is_happening_in_syrian_interim/,1,1637337494.0,"First of all, I want to preface by saying I think while PYD sucks, what is currently happening in the liberated territories really needs to be improved. 

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I just think something needs to be done to improve the situation with the Kurds, the current quasi-ethnic war is really detrimental.",1637337494.0,SyrianRebels

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

What the Azm Operations Room can learn from HTS,6,qrrrjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrrrjl/what_the_azm_operations_room_can_learn_from_hts/,3,1636655690.0,"Though the claim ""HTS is a rebranding of Nusra"" is partially true, it is not the full truth. HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels

There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here.

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant.

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

Concerning the Belarusian-Polish border issue,6,qpo2m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qpo2m6/concerning_the_belarusianpolish_border_issue/,5,1636407970.0,"Does one ever wonder why such an issue exists? I've not a doubt in my mind, that if the communist (semi socialist) regime were to have fallen when it was supposed to and that if the Kurds did not receive any support, this refugee issue would not exist.

I mention this, because living here in the West, many seem to think that Arabs (specifically Arabs) are dying to live amongst Westerners, which couldn't be farther from the truth. It's terrible listening to people say that they've not the right to seek refuge (whether temporary or long term) from a brutal dictatorship, even when they espouse that they themselves endured similar conditions not long ago (think Poland and the Baltics).

It is almost as though Syrians are to be told to suffer under this regime of theirs (obviously remaining in power by the will of external contributors) or quite literally die.

Also, I've always wondered, why do you all believe that so many voices have disappeared in the West? Do you believe that it is due to fear? Not sure.",1636407970.0,SyrianRebels

Ibrahim Bin Masud, who I normally highly respect, made an extremely wrongheaded statement.

[https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737](https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737)

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately.

IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive.

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

"Firas Saad : the Russians themselves, with the help and coordination of the Syrian regime and Iranians, were the ones who bombed the outskirts of Qardaha using a Russian Orion drone.",5,14jdpyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/14jdpyg/firas_saad_the_russians_themselves_with_the_help/,0,1687775735.0,"The Syrian opposition figure of Alawite descent, Firas Saad, said that he obtained information from a confidential source described as a ""friend"" that confirms the Russians themselves, with the help and coordination of the Syrian regime and Iranians, were the ones who bombed the outskirts of Qardaha using a Russian Orion aircraft.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

More than 36 hours after the earthquake buried their family as they slept, two toddlers caught between concrete in the ruins of their home in northern Syria have been freed.

The older youngster can be heard on film pleading with rescuers as they stand amid the ruins of the children's house in Besnaya-Bseineh, ""Get me out of here, I'll do anything for you.""

She continues, ""I'll be your servant,"" to the rescuer's ""No, no.""

They are huddled together in what might be the ruins of their bed, and the girl, Mariam, softly touches the hair on the head of her younger sibling. She is able to move her arm just far enough to shield her sibling's face from the debris and dust.",1676023714.0,SyrianRebels

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use. 

And no, im not trying to go on some anti turkish rant, but this is infuriating. Not simply because of Zenkis record but this crook getting special treatment while Syrians get deported over Bananna jokes.

Demarcating borders,2,xmjldq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/xmjldq/demarcating_borders/,0,1663995850.0,"If anyone here has been keeping up with whatever it is that has been taking place in Ukraine, the most terrifying of things to eventuate will be the demarcating of borders on the bases of foreign interests.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

> Ibrahim al-Shanti, a resident of Gaza City, told The New Arab: ""At a time when Hamas accepted to restore its relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who killed dozens of thousands of his people, what prevents it from restoring its relations with the Palestinian Authority, which did not commit such crimes,""


> Samia Al-Agbar, another Gaza-based resident, said to The New Arab, ""I cannot understand how Hamas can reconcile with Bashar al-Assad, who committed crimes against humanity no less than what Israel did against our people in Gaza and the West Bank. There is no doubt that the Assad regime is criminal and murderous, who caused the destruction of Syria and the displacement of millions of defenceless civilians,"" she added. ""Hamas has lost a lot of its popularity because of this irresponsible step.""


> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal. I think that the Palestinian people will not forgive the resistance movement (Hamas) on such a decision, especially since Assad's crimes are no less cruel than those committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians,""


> Ismail Atallah, from Gaza City, argues ""Hamas is an essential part of the resistance axis, which includes Syria and Iran (...) The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever. I think that Hamas took this decision to emphasise its connection with the Arab world, especially after Turkey, which hosts the majority of the movement's leaders, announced the restoration of its relations with Israel,""


> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support. Hamas suffers from political isolation at the Arab level, especially in light of Arab-Israeli normalisation and the return of relations between Turkey and Israel. It had to make its final decision between remaining alone in the confrontation or returning to the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah,""",1663627974.0,SyrianRebels

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

To those of you well intentioned, well meaning Kurds whom yearn to spend centuries more with their ""Arab"" brothers and otherwise, we hope to one day rebuild our nation amongst each other.

Not under the banner of ethnicity, nor the banner of self destructive ideologies pertaining to specific individuals and their convictions, but under the banner of cooperation, civil discourse and security.

I hope to one day see thriving Arab and Kurdish communities and for those of you whom do not wish for such a thing, may you be forsaken from attaining your perilous dreams.

They let Syria burn to the ground as Russian bombers hit hospitals, refugee camps and schools, turning Damascus, Aleppo and Idlib to rubble and many more places into hellholes. They let the beast get bigger, and now the West is paying the price for it.

Barely any media covered the topic. It was either about Daesh or refugees, but the topic of the Syrians suffering under Russia was purposely muted and at times construed. ""Alleged Russian bombings"".

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

Over the years ive learnt about Alawites (who have three subsects lunar solar and shepard). Yazidis and their seven angels, Sunnism and its simmilarites to Calvanism (predestination universal preisthood). I even learnt about the pre Christian religions like the Homs based cult of el-gabal a black stone that childern would be sacrificed too. Or the Ennum Elish were Marduk wins the cosmic civil war between the new gods and the primordial salt water dragon Tiamat and Absu avatar of the sweet water sea. 

But i still don't know anything about the Druze other than that they live in Sweada in the south, one of them lead the revolt aganist France. They were persecuted by Col Shishakli and they have a multicoloured star as their logo. 

But i still dont know what their religious belifes are. What do they believe when did their religion begin. Are they abrahamic? Are they an old religion like Zorosterianism?",1639088987.0,SyrianRebels

The econonomics of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,3,r922l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/r922l0/the_econonomics_of_hayat_tahrir_alsham/,0,1638660540.0,"[https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham](https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham)

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

It is nice to see Syrian refugees taking the time to educate Germans about this still existing regime of horror.

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I just think something needs to be done to improve the situation with the Kurds, the current quasi-ethnic war is really detrimental.",1637337494.0,SyrianRebels

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels

There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here.

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant.

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

A go to (supposed) rebuttal of theirs is that all Arabs are mercenaries and only their cause is legitimate, which only further lessens their legitimacy (including the legitimacy to continuously arm themselves).

He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive.

Abu Amshas recent statements,10,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

Azm Operations Room,5,p9gqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/p9gqnr/azm_operations_room/,2,1629653308.0,"Okay, after not being on reddti for a bit, I am suprised no one is talking about the Azm Operations Room.

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

Anyway, I went ahead and invited three of our more active and civil users to join the moderating team. Hopefully this will help refresh and improve the subreddit. If you ever need to get a hold of me, the best way to do so is to message me on Twitter: FreeSyrianMemes

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

What soured the relations between Saudi Arabia and the Syrian rebels?

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

> Ibrahim al-Shanti, a resident of Gaza City, told The New Arab: ""At a time when Hamas accepted to restore its relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who killed dozens of thousands of his people, what prevents it from restoring its relations with the Palestinian Authority, which did not commit such crimes,""


> Samia Al-Agbar, another Gaza-based resident, said to The New Arab, ""I cannot understand how Hamas can reconcile with Bashar al-Assad, who committed crimes against humanity no less than what Israel did against our people in Gaza and the West Bank. There is no doubt that the Assad regime is criminal and murderous, who caused the destruction of Syria and the displacement of millions of defenceless civilians,"" she added. ""Hamas has lost a lot of its popularity because of this irresponsible step.""


> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal. I think that the Palestinian people will not forgive the resistance movement (Hamas) on such a decision, especially since Assad's crimes are no less cruel than those committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians,""


> Ismail Atallah, from Gaza City, argues ""Hamas is an essential part of the resistance axis, which includes Syria and Iran (...) The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever. I think that Hamas took this decision to emphasise its connection with the Arab world, especially after Turkey, which hosts the majority of the movement's leaders, announced the restoration of its relations with Israel,""


> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support. Hamas suffers from political isolation at the Arab level, especially in light of Arab-Israeli normalisation and the return of relations between Turkey and Israel.

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

To those of you that wish well for your own people and for others, I have no bone to pick with you. 

To those of you well intentioned, well meaning Kurds whom yearn to spend centuries more with their ""Arab"" brothers and otherwise, we hope to one day rebuild our nation amongst each other.

Not under the banner of ethnicity, nor the banner of self destructive ideologies pertaining to specific individuals and their convictions, but under the banner of cooperation, civil discourse and security.

I hope to one day see thriving Arab and Kurdish communities and for those of you whom do not wish for such a thing, may you be forsaken from attaining your perilous dreams.

On that note, good day to you all.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

The econonomics of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,3,r922l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/r922l0/the_econonomics_of_hayat_tahrir_alsham/,0,1638660540.0,"[https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham](https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham)

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today. Give it 5 years it will be even worse. The end result will cause an eternal sectarian war in the region if this isnt halted",1636636954.0,SyrianRebels
Ibrahim Bin Masud is not who he seems,3,qrhlc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrhlc3/ibrahim_bin_masud_is_not_who_he_seems/,0,1636623261.0,"Now why am I making this post? Because I believe in transparency. Regardless of ones faction, fooling the public is a tactic I think we should avoid in general.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels
My crack at an essay on the Popular Resistance Companies,3,qrfbnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrfbnf/my_crack_at_an_essay_on_the_popular_resistance/,3,1636613750.0,"Now one would be tempted to call them an ""HTS component."" There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here. 

Now even the logo itself screams ""NDF.""

[It is literally an \\""islamified\\"" NDF logo lol](https://preview.redd.it/1au456tiwwy71.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4675a4b73c5c55a6584045d3b1e19218c8a5fd1d)

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant. 

Though HTS itself has now embraced the green flag: [https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864](https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864) (evidence) the Popular Resistance in particular waves it at most of its functions in general always embraces it [https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron\_10/status/1372240471368548352](https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron_10/status/1372240471368548352) (evidence)

SDF Yellow Shabiha files: Abu Khawla,1,qre8jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qre8jx/sdf_yellow_shabiha_files_abu_khawla/,7,1636609764.0,"FYI: I call PYD affiliated people ""Yellow Shabiha."" Don't twist it lol.

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

[This insect is pretty bad, even by Assadist standards](https://preview.redd.it/2xvl19gx8gy71.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=51204a8ec425f658ad18600639be6866d8728852)

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting.

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

A go to (supposed) rebuttal of theirs is that all Arabs are mercenaries and only their cause is legitimate, which only further lessens their legitimacy (including the legitimacy to continuously arm themselves).

He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive.

Abu Amshas recent statements,10,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

I know Syria was given its independence by the UK during WW2 after the British defeated the Vichy (pro German French) troops in Syria. So did the new leaders swap French for English because of that? I know Kudsi could speak English but i dont know if he or any of the other post indy leaders could speak French.

Azm Operations Room,4,p9gqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/p9gqnr/azm_operations_room/,2,1629653308.0,"Okay, after not being on reddti for a bit, I am suprised no one is talking about the Azm Operations Room.

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

I'm genuinely curious to know just exactly to what leading authority the region will answer to, potentially in place of all the idiots governing it. Whether we speak of the existing territories that belong to the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria and as well as Iraq (whom her people are yet to see the sheer idiocy of having removed Saddam).

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

Thanks for keeping the subreddit alive despite the mostly inactive moderating team. Reddit has changed a lot since I created it many years ago. I still find myself prefixing my urls with old.reddit because I don’t understand how to use new Reddit, and I’m sure I’m missing a lot of messages, chats, modmail, etc.

Anyway, I went ahead and invited three of our more active and civil users to join the moderating team. Hopefully this will help refresh and improve the subreddit. If you ever need to get a hold of me, the best way to do so is to message me on Twitter: FreeSyrianMemes

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

What soured the relations between Saudi Arabia and the Syrian rebels?

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

I say I don't know much so don't be too harsh. Thank you for reading",1673663598.0,SyrianRebels

Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal. I think that the Palestinian people will not forgive the resistance movement (Hamas) on such a decision, especially since Assad's crimes are no less cruel than those committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians,""

The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever.

> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support. Hamas suffers from political isolation at the Arab level, especially in light of Arab-Israeli normalisation and the return of relations between Turkey and Israel.

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today. Give it 5 years it will be even worse. The end result will cause an eternal sectarian war in the region if this isnt halted",1636636954.0,SyrianRebels
Ibrahim Bin Masud is not who he seems,3,qrhlc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrhlc3/ibrahim_bin_masud_is_not_who_he_seems/,0,1636623261.0,"Now why am I making this post? Because I believe in transparency. Regardless of ones faction, fooling the public is a tactic I think we should avoid in general.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels
My crack at an essay on the Popular Resistance Companies,3,qrfbnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrfbnf/my_crack_at_an_essay_on_the_popular_resistance/,3,1636613750.0,"Now one would be tempted to call them an ""HTS component."" There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here. 

Now even the logo itself screams ""NDF.""

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant. 

Though HTS itself has now embraced the green flag: [https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864](https://mobile.twitter.com/OmerOzkizilcik/status/1372648804902649864) (evidence) the Popular Resistance in particular waves it at most of its functions in general always embraces it [https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron\_10/status/1372240471368548352](https://mobile.twitter.com/mostameron_10/status/1372240471368548352) (evidence)

SDF Yellow Shabiha files: Abu Khawla,3,qre8jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qre8jx/sdf_yellow_shabiha_files_abu_khawla/,7,1636609764.0,"FYI: I call PYD affiliated people ""Yellow Shabiha."" Don't twist it lol.

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

[This insect is pretty bad, even by Assadist standards](https://preview.redd.it/2xvl19gx8gy71.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=51204a8ec425f658ad18600639be6866d8728852)

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

Ibrahim Bin Masud, who I normally highly respect, made an extremely wrongheaded statement.

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

They are ""Hazimis,"" in essence, too radical even for Daesh, their Takfir extending to those who dont pledge loyalty to them (much like the GIA did with the entire population of Algeria in the 90s)

Now I think the reason for their success is they are only made up of fanatics. They dont really control territory so anyone in the group joined voluntarily, and these are too extreme for Daesh keep in mind. It is going to be extremely hard to dislodge them are they are more numerous than Shishanis group and will fight to the death.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

They are a thorn in our sides and the more they attempt to make it clear to us that they've genuine claims, the less substantiated their presence becomes (specifically where it concerns the co-operation between the Kurds and Russia) on Syrian soil (particularly those not even from there).

A go to (supposed) rebuttal of theirs is that all Arabs are mercenaries and only their cause is legitimate, which only further lessens their legitimacy (including the legitimacy to continuously arm themselves).

I'm convinced that their supposed cause will continue to fall upon deaf ears and the recent declaration of persona non grata of some 10 ambassadors from Turkey is proof that Erdogan has a leg to stand on.",1635110452.0,SyrianRebels

Then the army officers stabbed each other in the back until Col Shishakli ruled the roost. He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive.

Abu Amshas recent statements,9,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

Azm Operations Room,5,p9gqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/p9gqnr/azm_operations_room/,2,1629653308.0,"Okay, after not being on reddti for a bit, I am suprised no one is talking about the Azm Operations Room.

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

The entire region is a sham and it seems to me like the will of the people is constantly and continuously crushed. To what end do you all believe? I'm genuinely curious to know just exactly to what leading authority the region will answer to, potentially in place of all the idiots governing it. Whether we speak of the existing territories that belong to the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria and as well as Iraq (whom her people are yet to see the sheer idiocy of having removed Saddam). 

I ask, because as a Westerner living in the West, I hate researching my region. There's never any good news.

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

Thanks for keeping the subreddit alive despite the mostly inactive moderating team. Reddit has changed a lot since I created it many years ago. I still find myself prefixing my urls with old.reddit because I don’t understand how to use new Reddit, and I’m sure I’m missing a lot of messages, chats, modmail, etc.

Anyway, I went ahead and invited three of our more active and civil users to join the moderating team. Hopefully this will help refresh and improve the subreddit. If you ever need to get a hold of me, the best way to do so is to message me on Twitter: FreeSyrianMemes

And of course, thanks to the new (and the old but still occasionally active) moderators for helping out.",1702355005.0,SyrianRebels

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

As every news outlet talking about Syria says, Assad is meeting with Saudi officials, who are even discussing about reintegrating his regime into the Arab League. How did this come to pass, given that in 2012, Saudi Arabia expelled Syria from the Arab League, giving its seat to the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces and calling it the ""sole legitimate representative of Syria""? What soured the relations between Saudi Arabia and the Syrian rebels? I figured this would be the right place to ask since I support the FSA and the only other Syrian subreddits I know of are r/Syria which doesn't seem to be too political and r/SyrianCirclejerkWar which.....no, just no.

She continues, ""I'll be your servant,"" to the rescuer's ""No, no.""

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Today marks the 11th anniversary of Mashaal Tammo's death days after being threatened by the PYD. He was one of the most prominent Kurdish figures who supported the Syrian revolution.,8,xy08bu,https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschaal_Tammo,0,1665152003.0,"Conveniently, English, Arabic, and Kurdish language wiki pages leave out the specific details. Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use. 

And no, im not trying to go on some anti turkish rant, but this is infuriating. Not simply because of Zenkis record but this crook getting special treatment while Syrians get deported over Bananna jokes.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support.

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

Particularly comparing the regime with Nazi Germany, which will have a strong effect. Most elements of German society have a strong sense of shame regarding that regime.

It is nice to see Syrian refugees taking the time to educate Germans about this still existing regime of horror.

Remember, educating people about the true horrors is important because the Assad regime is NOT simply your typical tinpot dictatorship, it is a systematic machine of exterminating any opposition.

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

What the Azm Operations Room can learn from HTS,6,qrrrjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrrrjl/what_the_azm_operations_room_can_learn_from_hts/,3,1636655690.0,"Though the claim ""HTS is a rebranding of Nusra"" is partially true, it is not the full truth. HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today.

Because I believe in transparency. Regardless of ones faction, fooling the public is a tactic I think we should avoid in general.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels

There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here.

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist.

Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

[This insect is pretty bad, even by Assadist standards](https://preview.redd.it/2xvl19gx8gy71.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=51204a8ec425f658ad18600639be6866d8728852)

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

I mention this, because living here in the West, many seem to think that Arabs (specifically Arabs) are dying to live amongst Westerners, which couldn't be farther from the truth. It's terrible listening to people say that they've not the right to seek refuge (whether temporary or long term) from a brutal dictatorship, even when they espouse that they themselves endured similar conditions not long ago (think Poland and the Baltics).

It is almost as though Syrians are to be told to suffer under this regime of theirs (obviously remaining in power by the will of external contributors) or quite literally die.

Ibrahim Bin Masud, who I normally highly respect, made an extremely wrongheaded statement.

[https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737](https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737)

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Then the army officers stabbed each other in the back until Col Shishakli ruled the roost. He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive. 

If one has seen my past posts I dont think neither government is ideal; but I also prefer greater unity. Warlordism and conflicting egos and financial interests has been a curse for the revolutionary cause historically.

Abu Amshas recent statements,10,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

More than 36 hours after the earthquake buried their family as they slept, two toddlers caught between concrete in the ruins of their home in northern Syria have been freed.

The older youngster can be heard on film pleading with rescuers as they stand amid the ruins of the children's house in Besnaya-Bseineh, ""Get me out of here, I'll do anything for you.""

She continues, ""I'll be your servant,"" to the rescuer's ""No, no.""

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Today marks the 11th anniversary of Mashaal Tammo's death days after being threatened by the PYD. He was one of the most prominent Kurdish figures who supported the Syrian revolution.,6,xy08bu,https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschaal_Tammo,0,1665152003.0,"Conveniently, English, Arabic, and Kurdish language wiki pages leave out the specific details. Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

I share this because if he uses likely looted wealth to reconsitute Zenki in the same style Jaish al-Islam was, we should immedietely call that out given his record.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use. 

And no, im not trying to go on some anti turkish rant, but this is infuriating. Not simply because of Zenkis record but this crook getting special treatment while Syrians get deported over Bananna jokes.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

""Hamas has lost a lot of its popularity because of this irresponsible step.""


> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal.

The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever.

> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support.

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

The econonomics of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,3,r922l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/r922l0/the_econonomics_of_hayat_tahrir_alsham/,0,1638660540.0,"[https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham](https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham)

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

It is nice to see Syrian refugees taking the time to educate Germans about this still existing regime of horror.

Fixing what is happening in Syrian Interim Government,4,qxj6zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qxj6zg/fixing_what_is_happening_in_syrian_interim/,1,1637337494.0,"First of all, I want to preface by saying I think while PYD sucks, what is currently happening in the liberated territories really needs to be improved. 

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I just think something needs to be done to improve the situation with the Kurds, the current quasi-ethnic war is really detrimental.",1637337494.0,SyrianRebels

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

What the Azm Operations Room can learn from HTS,6,qrrrjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qrrrjl/what_the_azm_operations_room_can_learn_from_hts/,3,1636655690.0,"Though the claim ""HTS is a rebranding of Nusra"" is partially true, it is not the full truth. HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels

There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here.

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant.

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand.

His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

Concerning the Belarusian-Polish border issue,6,qpo2m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qpo2m6/concerning_the_belarusianpolish_border_issue/,5,1636407970.0,"Does one ever wonder why such an issue exists? I've not a doubt in my mind, that if the communist (semi socialist) regime were to have fallen when it was supposed to and that if the Kurds did not receive any support, this refugee issue would not exist.

I mention this, because living here in the West, many seem to think that Arabs (specifically Arabs) are dying to live amongst Westerners, which couldn't be farther from the truth. It's terrible listening to people say that they've not the right to seek refuge (whether temporary or long term) from a brutal dictatorship, even when they espouse that they themselves endured similar conditions not long ago (think Poland and the Baltics).

It is almost as though Syrians are to be told to suffer under this regime of theirs (obviously remaining in power by the will of external contributors) or quite literally die.

Also, I've always wondered, why do you all believe that so many voices have disappeared in the West? Do you believe that it is due to fear? Not sure.",1636407970.0,SyrianRebels

Ibrahim Bin Masud, who I normally highly respect, made an extremely wrongheaded statement.

[https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737](https://twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1456295616728948737)

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately.

IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive.

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

As we’re aware the revolution started peacefully in some areas however in other areas it was undeniably violent and straight up terrorism you could say. For example literally a few weeks after the revolution started the Idlib, Jisr ash-Shughur, attack on government troops in a base were 100+ soldiers and young recruiters were massacred violently and with sectarian hatred, the regime later used that attack as an excuse to enter the city. 

Obviously both sides committed many massacres and violence in early 2011-2012 specially the regime, however you cannot deny the acts of terrorism carried out by the rebels even before the war officially started. (And the attack above was just one example), there are many videos on YouTube displaying similar events.

"Firas Saad : the Russians themselves, with the help and coordination of the Syrian regime and Iranians, were the ones who bombed the outskirts of Qardaha using a Russian Orion drone.",4,14jdpyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/14jdpyg/firas_saad_the_russians_themselves_with_the_help/,0,1687775735.0,"The Syrian opposition figure of Alawite descent, Firas Saad, said that he obtained information from a confidential source described as a ""friend"" that confirms the Russians themselves, with the help and coordination of the Syrian regime and Iranians, were the ones who bombed the outskirts of Qardaha using a Russian Orion aircraft.

According to Saad, the source stated that this operation is similar to previous ones, carried out due to the regime and its allies' assurance of the possibility of an Alawite uprising against the regime. This is something that does not suit the interests of the regime, Russians, or Iranians. The source continued, ""Therefore, intimidating the Alawites by staging terrorist acts attributed to the armed Islamic opposition is the only option available to the regime and Russians to prevent such a popular uprising in the coastal region.""

On Friday, local networks and pages revealed that the two drones that targeted the outskirts of Qardaha belong to Iranian militias stationed near the province. In a Facebook post, the pro-regime network ""Rahmo News"" mentioned that what happened in Qardaha was a security breach attributed to the so-called ""reserve forces,"" referring to the pro-regime thugs responsible for protecting the area from any armed attack.

The loyalist network exposed Assad's officers who kept silent about the incident and the true source of the attack. It revealed that intense disagreements occurred among them regarding how to respond to the Iranian drones' attack and their targeting of the hometown of Bashar al-Assad. The network confirmed that intensive communication took place between the deputy commander of the Fourth Division militia, Brigadier General ""Ali Mahmoud,"" and General ""Zaki Al-Saeed,"" in addition to ""Ali Assad,"" the cousin of the leader of the drug cartel.

The recent bombardment has raised doubts about the pretexts promoted by the Assad militias and their allies to justify their shelling of the liberated north, which claimed the lives of several civilians, including women and children, a few days ago. Particularly, the images of the drones circulated on social media match the drones proudly showcased by the mullahs' militia on every occasion.

Pro-regime pages mourned the young engineer, 25-year-old ""Mohammed Sultana,"" who was killed in Qardaha due to shells fired from drones. One of the shells landed in agricultural land next to the Qardaha clinic, causing minor injuries to another person and material damage to a building.

Meanwhile, other pro-regime pages accused opposition factions last Thursday of targeting the city of Salhab in northern Hama, resulting in the death of a child and a woman, and injuring three others in an attack carried out by a drone that targeted residential neighborhoods in the area.

More than 36 hours after the earthquake buried their family as they slept, two toddlers caught between concrete in the ruins of their home in northern Syria have been freed.

The older youngster can be heard on film pleading with rescuers as they stand amid the ruins of the children's house in Besnaya-Bseineh, ""Get me out of here, I'll do anything for you.""

She continues, ""I'll be your servant,"" to the rescuer's ""No, no.""

They are huddled together in what might be the ruins of their bed, and the girl, Mariam, softly touches the hair on the head of her younger sibling. She is able to move her arm just far enough to shield her sibling's face from the debris and dust.",1676023714.0,SyrianRebels

First of all, what do the Syrian people think about YPG, FSA or Assad in general? 

Secondly, why does the USA/west support the FSA, which both supports the YPG and fights them? 

thirdly, is the ISIS/FSA relationship correct? 

fourth and lastly, can I get your general opinion on Turkey's agreement with the Assad regime? 



Now, as a Turk, I am expressing my own opinions. As you know, there are a lot of Syrian refugees in Turkey and they are committing major crimes. A large majority in Turkey argues that the war in Syria is over and that the Syrians should return to their country. To be honest, Turkey and Assad are really tired of the war and want to come to an agreement (in my own country's interests) and end terrorist organizations(for Turkey) like the YPG/PKK and ISIS and return the refugees who are a huge burden to the Turkish economy.

Only the Dutch page mentioned it.

> We were threatened by the PYD and the PKK. It all started on a Friday during a demonstration. On that Friday, the PYD, other Kurdish parties and we demonstrated together. Mishʿal was also present. At the demonstration, PYD supporters carried PKK flags and pictures of Öcalan. Mishʿal asked the other party representatives why they accept this. Not only that, while the demonstrations took place all over Syria under a common motto, the PYD demonstrated under its own motto. Mishʿal said he would not accept that. He demanded that the PYD put down their flags and Öcalan's picture and run under the all-Syrian motto. Everyone should walk behind the Kurdish flag and the Syrian freedom flag, otherwise we would take our own route. He also said that he is not prepared to use the Kurds in Syria against Turkey. He said: “I live in Syria, I want to support the Syrian revolution and not give the impression that we are not against the regime. Our policy should be directed against the Syrian regime and not against Turkey. If we change the moth and wear pictures of Öcalan, it means we are not part of the Syrian revolution.” They couldn't agree. Mishʿal then told the young people to move towards the city center and destroy the statue of Assad. That was when the problems with the PYD began. Then they came home to Mishʿal and threatened him. They said, they and eleven other Kurdish parties would liquidate Mishʿal at-Tammu. ʿAbdurrazzaq and Marsil then went to the PYD man who had threatened Mishʿal and told him that the PYD should do what it thought was right. Kurdish parties later issued a statement claiming that Mishʿal threatened the PYD.

It is telling though that for a pretty serious crime he is already out. A literal triple manslaughter and less than a year of confinement. This makes me suspicious he is going to return to his career as a warlord and Turkey released him for some kind of use. 

And no, im not trying to go on some anti turkish rant, but this is infuriating. Not simply because of Zenkis record but this crook getting special treatment while Syrians get deported over Bananna jokes.

Demarcating borders,2,xmjldq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/xmjldq/demarcating_borders/,0,1663995850.0,"If anyone here has been keeping up with whatever it is that has been taking place in Ukraine, the most terrifying of things to eventuate will be the demarcating of borders on the bases of foreign interests.

Where does this concern Syria? Quite simple. If the Ukrainians cannot take back the lands swallowed by the Russians - by force - then the same will happen in Syria and those of the Syrians that sought refuge in other nations whom are not actively working to stop this from taking place, will be in for the rudest of surprises in the future: knowing that their country of origin is no longer theirs. Not just that. Knowing that if they are to ever return, they will never be able to choose who governs their nation, since it'll no longer be theirs anyway.

The Brits are obviously in on it, since Iraq was a stepping stone for what came to manifest in Syria. 

Why would I say that the Brits are in on it? This is partly down to the fact that the EU is eating itself up from the inside and there will come a time where every individual EU nation will want to do its own thing - independent of the EU and its dictates.

Are the Syrians really this divided? Do they not want their nation back? Or are they forever to be at the behest of foreign interests and continue to wallow away as a diaspora?

> Ibrahim al-Shanti, a resident of Gaza City, told The New Arab: ""At a time when Hamas accepted to restore its relations with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who killed dozens of thousands of his people, what prevents it from restoring its relations with the Palestinian Authority, which did not commit such crimes,""


> Samia Al-Agbar, another Gaza-based resident, said to The New Arab, ""I cannot understand how Hamas can reconcile with Bashar al-Assad, who committed crimes against humanity no less than what Israel did against our people in Gaza and the West Bank. There is no doubt that the Assad regime is criminal and murderous, who caused the destruction of Syria and the displacement of millions of defenceless civilians,"" she added. ""Hamas has lost a lot of its popularity because of this irresponsible step.""


> Saleh al-Naami, a Gaza-based political analyst, said to The New Arab that Hamas' decision ""is unfortunate and painful, and there is no real justification for such a step (...) All the interests that may combine between Hamas and Syria are false and unreal. I think that the Palestinian people will not forgive the resistance movement (Hamas) on such a decision, especially since Assad's crimes are no less cruel than those committed by the Israeli occupation against the Palestinians,""


> Ismail Atallah, from Gaza City, argues ""Hamas is an essential part of the resistance axis, which includes Syria and Iran (...) The movement expressed its total rejection of Assad's crimes, but this does not mean that it should maintain its political estrangement from him forever. I think that Hamas took this decision to emphasise its connection with the Arab world, especially after Turkey, which hosts the majority of the movement's leaders, announced the restoration of its relations with Israel,""


> Mukhaimar Abu Saada, another Gaza-based political analyst, believes that Hamas ""does not have the full ability to refuse to restore relations with Syria, because of its close relations with Iran, the main ally of the Assad regime, which provides it with money, weapons and other logistical support. Hamas suffers from political isolation at the Arab level, especially in light of Arab-Israeli normalisation and the return of relations between Turkey and Israel. It had to make its final decision between remaining alone in the confrontation or returning to the alliance between Iran, Syria and Hezbollah,""",1663627974.0,SyrianRebels

**September 12, 2022.** The Antidote Community, a group of independent electronic music producers and DJs from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, released an electronic music album as a statement against all of the world’s dictators. Titled Sound of Freedom, the record mixes soundbites from various autocratic rulers with techno music beats, which have been historically used in protests against undemocratic regimes for years.

Edmundas Pučkorius, manager of the Antidote project, explained that this album is a representation of their community’s belief in the transformative power of culture and, more specifically, electronic music. Electronic music and raves have been used as a form of resistance and national unity in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including clean-up raves to restore devastated spaces and celebrations of the country’s Independence day in Vilnius. In general, Lithuania’s capital city is home to a burgeoning and active electronic music scene.

“For the first time since 2004, there are more autocratic states than democracies around the world. People ruled by a dictator are gripped within an information trap: propaganda, censorship, and fake narratives,” said Pučkorius. “In the Sound of Freedom, seven music producers directly resist such dictators by appropriating their words to send a message of hope and freedom — a move that would surely get the record banned in autocracies.”

The album and its cover image were unveiled in Vilnius’ [Open Gallery](https://opengallery.lt/en/) — a unique open-air art gallery in the New Town of the city. Named The Ultimate Dictator, the artwork is a composite portrait generated using an AI that combined the faces of 40 dictators.

“We wanted to identify the face of evil. To do that, we ranked countries using data from a few independent freedom and democracy indexes. Forty countries with the worst results were picked. Then, using an AI visual tool, we morphed these dictators’ faces into one to get the ultimate dictator, which was used as a basis to create the artwork,” explained Pučkorius.

The artwork was painted by Pijus Čeikauskas, with the portrait emerging from a brick wall, evoking images that feel similar to George Orwell’s “big brother” from the dystopian novel *1984*. Unpolished yellow markings cover the image, a reference to how protesters defacing images of autocratic rulers have to act quickly to avoid being caught.

The newest artwork displayed in Open Gallery has been presented as part of the Loftas fest’22 event, which takes place from the 8th to the 11th of September. It features a wide array of performances from different musicians and various art installations held in a repurposed factory and industrial zone. Loftas also features the largest display of street art in Vilnius, which is constantly expanded with new artwork from globally-renowned muralists.

To those of you well intentioned, well meaning Kurds whom yearn to spend centuries more with their ""Arab"" brothers and otherwise, we hope to one day rebuild our nation amongst each other.

Not under the banner of ethnicity, nor the banner of self destructive ideologies pertaining to specific individuals and their convictions, but under the banner of cooperation, civil discourse and security.

They let Syria burn to the ground as Russian bombers hit hospitals, refugee camps and schools, turning Damascus, Aleppo and Idlib to rubble and many more places into hellholes. They let the beast get bigger, and now the West is paying the price for it.

Barely any media covered the topic. It was either about Daesh or refugees, but the topic of the Syrians suffering under Russia was purposely muted and at times construed. ""Alleged Russian bombings"".

An observation,3,sclrct,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/sclrct/an_observation/,0,1643138974.0,"Have you noticed how people online have been constantly trying to make a case for a Russian invasion of Ukraine? That communism, Ba'thism and any form of theocratic governance is what certain people need, supposedly because of how conservative they are?

It seems to me like these same types of people will have no issue making a case for a torture program designed to uproot an entire people and have goons from an entire region act against you.

Do you also notice how European nations are willing to come together over Ukraine and support its people, rather than act against it? 

First, it was the migrants from Syria and Iraq fleeing their nations from the form of governance imposed on them.

Secondly, dealing with those that do not want them on their own soil, but also don't care if whether they're living or not.

Thirdly, the blame placed on them for being responsible for the state of their nations.

Fourthly, the hypocrisy of those that shout ""secularism, liberalism"", whilst supporting theocratic rule and rule by proxy.

Fifthly, Western conservatives only ever worrying about the state of their nations and the influence migrants have on their own, rather than mentioning how those migrants would rather live with their own than put up with the shit they do in nations they are alien to.",1643138974.0,SyrianRebels

Over the years ive learnt about Alawites (who have three subsects lunar solar and shepard). Yazidis and their seven angels, Sunnism and its simmilarites to Calvanism (predestination universal preisthood). I even learnt about the pre Christian religions like the Homs based cult of el-gabal a black stone that childern would be sacrificed too. Or the Ennum Elish were Marduk wins the cosmic civil war between the new gods and the primordial salt water dragon Tiamat and Absu avatar of the sweet water sea. 

But i still don't know anything about the Druze other than that they live in Sweada in the south, one of them lead the revolt aganist France. They were persecuted by Col Shishakli and they have a multicoloured star as their logo. 

But i still dont know what their religious belifes are. What do they believe when did their religion begin. Are they abrahamic? Are they an old religion like Zorosterianism?",1639088987.0,SyrianRebels

The econonomics of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham,3,r922l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/r922l0/the_econonomics_of_hayat_tahrir_alsham/,0,1638660540.0,"[https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham](https://www.mei.edu/publications/economics-hayat-tahrir-al-sham)

In my opinion, this is the most in depth article explainining their economic ""monopoly"" over Idlib. 

What is worth noting under the supposedly ""very corrupt warlord"" Jamal Maarouf, anyone could partake in getting oil and selling them, offering more local economic opportunities for the average civilian. Additionally it is telling that today Jamal Maarouf is a simple construction worker again (while other warlords in exiles open fancy resturants in Turkey.)

Proof: [https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545](https://twitter.com/KohNagao/status/1326104524776300545)

This is not to potray Jamal Maarouf as some angel, as he was indeed a warlord and partook in some instances of abuses and thuggery. But he was considerably less corrupt that most other factions evidently, including HTS who used his supposed thuggery as an excuse to attack.

What I will say is why I am so critical of this HTS economic monopoly in Idlib? The corrrupt of Mustafa Qadid is not unlike that of the old Makhlouf and Tlass families of the regime. Or it is not unlike the business empire that Mazloum Abdi is creating in the Northeast. These economic ""monopolies"" only hinder the average civilians economic mobility (it is much harder to start businesses, etc, unless they get permission from ""higher ups"") leads to more corruption and cronyism, and the blatant lack of transparency is not unlike other warning stories (Jaish al-Islam linked businessmen in Douma who would do behind the table dealings with Qaterji, Isis business with regime, both used similarly shadowy networks in order to work with regime front companies.)

In fact,  Jaish al Islam should be a telling case of sorts for Idlib. Much as Jolani does today, Alloush would attack other factions in Ghouta for ""unity."" To both their credits, they built of disciplined militaty forces and compromised on previous elements of their ideology. Yet when Alloush died, what happened was 1. An immediete power struggle within Jaish al-Islam and decline of the org. 2. Old rivals such as al Rahman and al Nusra sought to settle scores and regain relevance as independent orgs within ghouta. 3. Without Alloush to keep discipline in the org, ideologues such as Samir Kaaka would make infighitng worse, and Ghouta could never achieve near unity again. 

In my opinion the best course of HTS is to build more bridges. Keep its military strength, but stop trying to monopolize all aspects of governance in Idlib. If it doesnt change course, if Abu Mohammed an Jolani  we will see a familar story unfold in Idlib, where other groups will opportunistically attack it, and furthermore, a general degeneration of HTS as an organization. 

The fact is, the current peace in Idlib is fragile, and not simply in the sense of a risk of a regime assault. There is certainly still bad blood between groups, and the Fatah Mubeen is likely more fragile than HTS likes to potray it is as. It could face the same fate as the Unified Military Command of East Ghouta.",1638660540.0,SyrianRebels

It is nice to see Syrian refugees taking the time to educate Germans about this still existing regime of horror.

While evidence shows there are efforts to return displaced Kurds to Afrin, I think not enough is being done. I think most of the SNA factions there should move to Aleppo countryside or Idlib, where they have more organic ties with. 

In Afrin, I think what is called “Roj Peshmerga” should be built up there. The overuse of the Turkish flag should stop. Abusive factions like Abu Amshat and Jabhat al Shamiya should face some kind of disciplinary actions. 

The fact of the matter is, these factions not being held to any kind of law is going to keep displaced Kurds terrified of returning, and i cant blame them either. There is also the fact that until local hearts and minds are legitimately won over, the “Afrin Liberation Forces” will be able to continue their insurgency and terrorism.

I just think something needs to be done to improve the situation with the Kurds, the current quasi-ethnic war is really detrimental.",1637337494.0,SyrianRebels

I see a lot of Assadists more or less use the racist argument that “Syrians cant be democratic” etc but the fact is Syria has had historically democratic rule before. 

Even the colonial French mandate was less oppressive than Ba’ath rule too, and allowed more civic life which says a lot about how terrible the Ba’ath rule has been. The Ba’ath think more low of their people then Syria’s former colonizers ever did.

Also, FYI, Joshua Landis has family as part of the Syrian regime. He also claimed in early 2011 that the Arab spring wouldn’t each Syria because Assad was “young and popular.” Maher Barotchi is able to correct his semi colonial rooted narrative here.",1637328968.0,SyrianRebels

HTS began as a project not unlike Azm; that is, an attempt to unify factions. 

[Ansar al-Din Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansar_al-Din_Front), [Jaysh al-Sunna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaysh_al-Sunna), [Liwa al-Haqq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liwa_al-Haqq_(Idlib)), and the [Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nour_al-Din_al-Zenki_Movement) where the first to join. It later expanded, with local revolutionary factions in Idlib joining it, as well as foreign fighter battalions. 

Today, you never hear of Jaysh al-Sunna. Nor Liwa al-Haqq. They are completely embedded in the HTS identity. There are sub armies, yes, like the ""Army of Abu Bakr Siddiq"" but it is entirely centralized and unified. 

This needs to be the end goal with Azm. Though I disprove of any faction monopolozing power I believe in forced unity. Just as HTS built a unified army in Idlib, Azm should work on a unified army in the Aleppo countryside. Not only will this curb factionalism, but it will also increase order. 

With a loose coalition like the ""Southern Front"" there were many personalites and egoes. The regime was easily able to subdue it as a result. A unified army would prevent individual ""frog battalions"" from spoiling the liberated areas. 

Infighting killed Daraa. Killed Ghouta. Killed Deir Ezzor. Unification saved Idlib. Unificaiton can save the Northern Aleppo countryside. 

There isnt really an excuse for not doing this either. Northern Aleppo countryside is under Turkish protection, which gives plenty of space to reform the Azm Operations Room into a proper army. Much easier circumstances than what HTS had to deal with. 

I do have some suggestions. The leading commander should be from outside existing factions, so as not to alienate any of them and create a power struggle. I suggest Riad al Assad should be at the head. Yet all the factional commanders should be integrated, so that they are on board, and made commanding officers. I suggest before full integration, several ""joint forces"" are created so to built trust between different units. 

Also, I think this theoretical unified army should be supplemanted with something similar to the ""Popular Resistance"" that is in Idlib, as a force multiplier. 

A unified, non sectarian, and well desciplined rebel army would make the aleppo countryside a magnet for free syrians of all sects, and could help created a more appealing model for a future free syria alltogether.",1636655690.0,SyrianRebels

Iran is exploiting tribes who claim prophetic lineages and trying to convert them towards Shiism. This is in Deir Ezzor, but there is more too it not mentioned in the article.

This isnt simply a Deir Ezzor phenomen. Iran has been trying to push Alawite and Ismaili Shias towards twelver Shia conversion as well. Likely, if they push Shia conversions on those sects, it extends to Druze and Christians too.

Syrias modern cultural heritage can be traced all the way back to the Orthodox Christian Byzantine Empire and the Ummayed Caliphate. what has NO role in Syrian culture and demographics are the Safavids. Yet iran is pushing Safavid culture on Syria; not just through conversions but settler colonialism done by Iraqi Shia, Afghan Shia, and even Pakistani Shia militia families. 

This is not unlike the rise of Shiism in Iran. Previously, Iran was Sunni with sizable Zoroastrian minority. The Safavids not only did these forced conversions, but also “imported” Shia from Lebanon due to the initial lack of Shia in Iran. 

What is happening is a cultural genocide of Syria. Literal colonialism too. Exploiting the weak and opportunistic elite. Check. Settling. Check. Imposition of a foreign culture. Check. Sending “religious missionaries” for political reasons. Check.

If Assad stays in power there wont be a Syria. I dont mean that figuratively. Not only will destruction be worsening but culturally Syria will be trampled. No sect is going to be exempt either.

Yes, Iranian missionary activity in Syria is not new and goes back to the 80s, but Bashar has lately been openly encouraging this. This is going to destroy local society on a level Saddams “faith campaign” did. Much of the military elite in Assads Syria is already ideologically sympathetic to iran today.

This has little to do with HTS itself. But it is a warning case against “journalists” that pretend to be “neutral.”

I knew something was up when I saw his shilling for HTS has increased lately. To the point of borderline slandering his former friends. I assumed he was just trying to protect his own ass from persecution by licking HTS boots. Well, I kinda wish that was simply the case…

https://archive.sclqld.org.au/qjudgment/2017/QCA17-085.pdf

The truth is his real name is Abraham Succarieh. He is from Brisbane. and as these court documents show, he was a Nusra operator as early as 2013. He at one point was a Nusra commander! 

https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CEDAW/Shared%20Documents/AUS/INT_CEDAW_NGO_AUS_31450_E.pdf

His affiliation with what became HTS goes back to when Nusra had little in the way of ideological differences with Daesh. At this time, Nusra was known to view the revolutionary flag as a sign of “Sahwa” (a reference to the awakening in Iraq when ISI, proto Daesh, was defeated by a Sunni uprising backed by America against it) and was very much prohibited. (Even Ahrar al-Sham openly allowed the flag only in 2017). At the time of his membership, Nusra was generally openly genocidal against Syrian minorities (no, not just Alawites). 

Today he brags about Christian villages in Idlib:

https://mobile.twitter.com/ibrahimbinmasud/status/1386794553928265731

Interestingly he vaguely referenced “mistakes” too. Mistake implies accidental folly. No, killings of minorities are war crimes. And it is not the “revolution” but his own militia that were the key perpetrators 

Now you may ask: whats the big fucking deal? you’re not exactly super anti HTS yourself?

My problem is he brands himself as a “researcher and idlib resident.” He makes no reference to the fact he was a Mujahid. He puts on a false cloak of neutrality. Yet the fact he is an HTS operative is not new!

In all likelihood, his current role is probably a “task” assigned by the HTS leadership given he is an English speaker. Act like a neutral, mainstream Islamic activist who lives in Idlib for Dawah purposes. Softly spin the narrative in favor of HTS.

I will eleborate. He has done some good stuff. BUT HE IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE! He is inevitably going to spin anything for HTS. His own “name” on social media is an alias, something commonly done by HTS commanders",1636623261.0,SyrianRebels

There is an element of truth in that. Even Jolani admitted HTS has at least  ""something"" to do with the Salvation Government. Yet the Salvation Government is quite more broad than HTS. Rather than being dominated by its paramilitary core, it is local technocrats, some Ikhwan affiliated, or perhaps even having been employed by the regime at one point, or even in the past part of mainstream opposition platforms. For example, their Interior Minister was formely part of the Free Police, which was disbanded by HTS forcefully. So yes, it is an HTS creation, but HTS is quite flexible here.

And to be honest, this is literally just ""HTS NDF."" Look at its structures. Much like NDF are composed of local regime loyalists to defend ""their areas"" Popular Resistance in Idlib are local militias organized by the Salvation Govenrment. If you look at their formation on the eve of 2019, generally the companies were named after their respecitve towns. ""Adana Popular Resistance."" ""Ma'arat Misrin Popular resitance."" One after Khan Sheikhoun etc. Unfortunately, some of the towns were captured. That likely means when that happens, the local unit ceases to exist. Yet the ""Popular Resistance"" remains across areas where HTS and its shell salvation government in dominant.

Initially, Abu Khawla joined the revolution. He came from a modest background. Prior to the revolution, he was a known bike theif.  While in the ranks of the revolutionaries, he was known for his wonderful service of robbing people at checkpoints, and letting actual revolutionaries do the fighting while he and his criminal militia looted areas that the regime had fled from and were liberated. 

Hungry for cash, he also would occasionally pass on information to the regime. Anything for a dollar, I guess. Then came Daesh. The group came in, utterly fucked up his group of bandits, so he pledged allegience, and they continued thier criminality, albiet they decided they were now Jihadists. (almost impeccable timing right, after getting fucked up by Daesh, HA, WE ARE DAESH!) Yet his brother was executed for continuing that crimanlity (Daesh does have some standards, as much as they are bastards) so Abu Khawla was like, ""oh shit im next."" so he fled like a pussy. 

First he came to Tel Abyad, then Turkey. He went back into Syria, linked up with the YPG who decided, ""you look arab enough, and your from Deir Ezzor, we need you to put up a token image of pluralism and not look too openly racist."" Abu Khawla was like ""yeah, just let me continue my checkpoints, ya know, gotta make sure people are safe, totally not gonna rob the shit out of them"" YPG was like ""hell yeah dude, biji Rojava!""

He headed to ""Deir Ezzor Military Council."" Kinda a lazy name if you ask me. It is telling there was no ""revolutionary"" imagery but all the familiar PKK yellow colors. The council claims to have 1700 men, which is laughable, and makes really shitty promo videos. feel free to watch it to get some free cringe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vejQCjNyfo)

&#x200B;

So time for me to report on what I think was one of his worst crimes. There was an old brigade in Deir Ezzor, named the ""Arab Ahwaz Brigade."" No, it was not made of foreign fighters, it was just named to honor Iranian occupied Ahwaz and their struggle for freedom. It split from Ahrar al Sharqiyah, not really for any political reasons, but it wanted to join the Deir Ezzor Military council in order to liberate their region from Daesh (a noble reason.) Their commander known as ""Abu Isaac al Ahwazi"" was a respected free army commander, not some criminal, he defected from the SAA because of the regimes abuses. Anyway, this young, charismatic leader, Abu Khawla saw as a threat, given Abu Khawla was a more aged, disliked, and inexperienced ""commander."". So according to reliable sources (family) he murdered al Ahwazi in a car bomb, pinning it on Daesh. 

Today Abu Khawla makes deals with the regime to send oil to them, and in turn he earns massive profits. He is glorified as an ""Emir"" of his tribe, even though he has no social significance, he simply got to the top through criminality. I would classify him as another ""Kadyrov Esque opportunisit."" He runs Deir Ezzor as if it is his private fiefdom, and the PYD is ok with that because he gives them a token image of inclusivity amonng ethnic groups and is enough of an ass kisser.

Madloul Omar al-Aziz originally claimed to be with the revolution. Reportedly, he was known for his criminality as a brigand. (in this way, parrelells can be drawn with Abu Khawla, also from Deir Ezzor.) He was a commander in Jabhat al-Nusra, and was known locally as ""the slaughterer"" for his exceptional fondness of slaughtering regime pows.

However in 2014 a problem for him arose with Daesh evicted most revolutionaries from the province, so he fled and reconciled with the regime. He established a militia affiliated with air force intelligence, and as a criminal, he remained known for his criminality. His militia incorporated some of his former Deiri Nusra comrades. *What is worth noteing: 2013 Nusra, which he was a member then, was considerably more radical than current HTS, and had barely begun to have rifts with ISI at the time (isis precursor, im not blaming it on pakistans agency lol) so much for the regime claiming to ""protect minorities.""*

Unlike other frogs like Ahmed al-Awda, he did not even claim to ""reconcile"" for his constituencies interest. Almost overnight, he was wearing the regime uniform proudly and waving the regime flag. However I do not think he was a regime agent from the get go, given his modest backround. He is likely simply an awful person and opportunist, much like Rashid Abu Khawla of the SDF. Lately, he has been known for land grabbing, disguised as ""reconstruction.""

The thing is, the regime, for all its brutality, still does never trust these ""reconciled"" people. It is often only a matter of time before they are liquidated or imprisoned again. So with the help of some Iranian agents, he ran in the 2020 Syrian Parlimentary election, in order to secure immunity from any perseuction from the regime security apparatus.  In the end he ""won"" the fradulent election and now has a seat in the Syrian parliment. Due to the damage his past does to the regimes image even among their most hardcore loyalists, there is currently a massive PR campaign in the regime to downplay his past, when he was known for slaughtering regime elements without mercy.

So yeah. An ex-jihadist who suddenly discovered his interest in Assadism with almost impeccable timing when rivals were about to wipe him out. And now a Syrian warlord Parlimentarian

My particular issue with this, is he is basically indirectly calling Bilal Abdul Kareem a traitor. I dont see eye to eye with Bilal Abdul Kareem as my post history shows, but he is no traitor simply for believing HTS sold some areas. Abd al Ashida is definitately no traitor either. 

Bilal was his FRIEND. I understand not calling out HTS out of fear of its security apparatus, but throwing your own FRIEND under the bus?

As much as I disagree with Bilals current hyper focus on HTS, they did oppress him in a very real way, and he witnessed what happened on the frontlines, wheras Ibrahim Bin Masud did not, he is more of a regular immigrant in Idlib who has not done fighting nor serious reporting. 

Once again, I don't expect him to call out HTS security apparatus. Given its extreme brutality, I would not openly dare do it publically. Yet this level of bootlicking, probably as an ""extra measure"" to win favor from HTS and their salvation government, is disgusting. 

This is why my moral is so low; when people call out the legitimate issues that are faced by the Salvation or Interem government, rahter than those issues being addressed, they get called traitors and agents every fucking time, and it damages the revolution",1636240496.0,SyrianRebels

More observations,4,qld3he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/qld3he/more_observations/,0,1635884065.0,"Notice how certain groups are holding strong to their narratives? The idea that one can justify their actions by presenting to you that you are somehow in debt to them tells me that that is a weak cause. 

Because, provided they hold firm to their narratives, they could somehow ensure a future of their own on Syrian soil, at the cost of the reality on the ground, which is that the vast majority of those that have suffered and continue to suffer are Syrian Arabs. 

Whatever attempt to justify a cause for why they're fighting, all of their opponents scream out ""ISIS, ISIS"" or that ""Turkey and Qatar sponsor terror"". I've never understood how anyone has ever had the hide to turn around and say to their opponents that they've no right to defend themselves, let alone arm themselves and that all their opponents should somehow cede their lands and capitulate to the demands of others.

Specifically when these opponents (of the Syrian Arabs) are mostly foreign actors, not from the nation itself and will do everything that entails their supposed cause to thwart their stay on Syrian soil and will work with anyone, victimise themselves (although they are the aggressors) and yet, still cannot buttress a case for their stay in Syria.

The other observation is that by them victimising themselves, everyone else is a supposed ""terrorist"". So, when it comes to the crunch, anyone they openly declare a ""terrorist"", one automatically presumes that proxy forces (such as SDF, PYD, Iran, Hezbollah and the many other plethora of true terrorists) receive foreign support/aid for their stay on Syrian soil. This is why it does not at all surprise me that all of their narratives are aligned with each other or will come to align with each other.

To add, federalising Syria is not a happening thing in the long-term, because the Kurds that have carried out terrorist acts against Turkey will present perpetual threats to Turkey's sovereignty in the present and in the future.

Specifically Arab Syrians. Just because Kurdish diaspora intend to live with other Kurds, will never agree to cutting up land on the bases of ethnicity, religious differences or stupid claims. Particularly the one I love the most, which is the claim of genocide. Who is it that remains displaced within their own borders, threatened with capital punishment externally and made to seem as though they're the aggressor? That's right. The Syrian Arab.

Essentially as HTS used the justification this group was ""Khawarij"" when the group took HTS captives they asked the HTS members what that means. The HTS member replied ""Kuffar."" What is important to note is that in Islam while Khawarij is a negative connotation is does not takfir a person.

A go to (supposed) rebuttal of theirs is that all Arabs are mercenaries and only their cause is legitimate, which only further lessens their legitimacy (including the legitimacy to continuously arm themselves).

He was later toppled and exiled in the 54 Revolution after he tried persecuting the Druze and failed tk invade Lebanon. 10 years later he was hunted down and killed in Brazil. This was 1 year after the Baathists ousted the last democratic government. 

Is there any evidence that the man who shot the flowery colonel was working for or assisted by the Baath Party? They are certainly no strangers to assassinating dissidents in exile (including ironically Salah al-din al-Bitar the party co founder).

Progress? It looks like greater coordination has been opening up lately. Hopefully through the two units fraternizing (salvation gov uses GSS I dont know the name of the aleppo unit; maybe a Free Police affiliated force?) can help build bridges. IMO, for local order this is undoubtedly a positive.

Abu Amshas recent statements,8,pplmd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/pplmd0/abu_amshas_recent_statements/,3,1631824799.0,"[https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/](https://7al.net/2021/09/10/بسبب-الجولاني-وتغزّل-ابو-عمشة-صراع-م/malek-h/slide/)

[https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085](https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/511085)

I urge people to ignore the kind of clickbait title on the first link, which claims this could cause a ""conflict between National Army and HTS.""

To sum it up:

Abu Amsha recently said he wants to increase cooperation with Hayat Tahrir al Sham. He praised them for their fight against the regime, and said ""they are people of this country."" He supports a theoretically integration of all opposition factions, and has said HTS has ""changed for the better.""

This is notable, because I honestly wouldnt be suprised if a faction like ""Levant Front"" or ""Ahrar al Sharqiya"" made such moves, but this is a for the most part, completely non ideological rebel faction (other than Turkmen identity politics forming a major component.) Now this further increases my view that in 2021 syria, the pull of ideology in general is decreasing.

Ive always opposed the falacious views that HTS is some kind of ""Syrian Taliban"" (though the HTS leadership claims to admire the Taliban, even the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Rifai linked to the interiem government praise the Taliban too) or that the SNA has ""no roots to the original FSA."" 

The key advantage currently enjoyed by HTS is it currently has a monopoly of force in Idlib. In the Aleppo countryside, fighting happens quite often between the different factions, and no faction is really powerful enough to wipe out a different group. 

And now it is not only Jolani changing aesthetics. HTS cleric Abd al Rahim Atoun (no, not the Idlibi clerics co opted by HTS and serving in their Awfaq in the salvation government, Abd al Rahim Atoun is a literal HTS cleric who goes back to Nusra days) 

[From This](https://preview.redd.it/6ide5muwexn71.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e2916693e6a4349ae9bcadc0ecb09afd948ba01)

This confirms my view that while HTS is going to retain a ""Pan Sunni' identity of sort, it is transforming into an organization more like 2015 era Jaish al Islam in douma or late era Ahrar al Sham than any kind of ""Jihadi"" group.

I expect it is only a matter of time before Jolani proclaims his desire to retain good relaitons with minorities like Zahran Alloush did when he was nearing his death",1631824799.0,SyrianRebels

Azm Operations Room,6,p9gqnr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SyrianRebels/comments/p9gqnr/azm_operations_room/,2,1629653308.0,"Okay, after not being on reddti for a bit, I am suprised no one is talking about the Azm Operations Room.

[https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/](https://english.enabbaladi.net/archives/2021/08/a-counterforce-facing-hayat-tahrir-al-shams-influence-in-aleppo/)

This has a somewhat misleading title, as the Azm Operations Room is not designed to ""counter HTS"" but rather improve stability. Unfortunately Aleppo countryside SNA areas have been unstable with carbombings, infighting, etc. Azm seeks to counter that. 

""In mid-July, the al-Jabha al-Shamiya (Levant Front) and the Sultan Murad Division announced the formation of a new operations room called Azm (determination), and later they were joined by other military factions, all incorporated in the SNA.

Factions that joined Azm Operations Room were seeking further and higher levels of security and military coordination to crack down on networks and cells threatening society’s security.

The official social media accounts of the Levant Front and the Sultan Murad Division mentioned that a security campaign was carried out in Azaz city of northern Aleppo and Afrin region to capture drug dealers and wanted persons. ""

Let us remember that not too long ago these factions would clash. So this is progress.

""The Army of Islam, Ahrar al-Sharqiya, al-Sharqiya Army, al-Hamza Division, and the brigades of Malek Shah, the Northern Hawks, and Suleiman Shah have joined the room following the announcement of its formation. ""

Why is this important? First of all let us look at the advantage of Salvation Government Land.

HTS has a monopoly of force. At this point no one dares start shooting matches with them. Say what you want about HTS, but they have made improvments with regards to the stability of Idlib. Now look at the SNA, it has so many factions often at odds with each other, even to the point of clashes.

With the ""Azm Operations Room"" increasing coordination and centralization, as well as dealing with criminals, PKK bomber cells, the liveability of the Aleppo countryside liberated areas will improve. It increases the viability of the safe zone. It could bring a degree of stability both to the people living in these areas and also to the internally displaced having moved there. 

Ideally; this is the beginning of the end of factionalism in the SNA; which seems to be taking a hint from HTS, to curb infighting and push for a more unified structure.",1629653308.0,SyrianRebels

Some points of the video: 
- A agreement was made by America, The EU, Turkey, Russia, and the GCC for the political solution in syria, which includes: 
- Returning all lands to the syrian government (Excluding Kurdish territories) 
- Unarming all groups in syria
- Imprisoning all terrorists
- Implementing un resolution 2254 and having UN monitored elections

After all of this has been achieved, the kurdish held territories will then be under the new syrian government.

More notes that were mentioned in this video: 
- Arab league brought back Assad with American supervision 
- There will occur in a step by step process to ensure that a power vacuum doesn't occur just like what happened in Libya
- Re-establishment of syrian consulates had american supervision
- Iranian militias have no place in syria as they will be expelled by america and israel soon (We can see that they have been implementing this by killing of big Iranian leaders) 


Samir Matini has made many videos like this in the past and all have been true (For example, Aleppo being back into the regime's territory, etc)

What're your thoughts?

The 2nd photo shows what it say is Kudsi being forced to resign. While it looks like him is it? How many had a colour camera in Syria in 63? Also wasn't Kudsi nearly killed? The Baathists publicly hanged 20 of his followers after their coup. So if they caught him wouldn't they kill him? 

This leads me to think it's from a film. Or maybe staged photo with the real Kudsi later. Kudsi was everything the baathists hated. A civic nationalist democratic pro West Kurd. That's 4 reasons already for the baathists to want him dead let alone being the elected president.",1707656242.0,SyrianRebels

Anyway, I went ahead and invited three of our more active and civil users to join the moderating team. Hopefully this will help refresh and improve the subreddit. If you ever need to get a hold of me, the best way to do so is to message me on Twitter: FreeSyrianMemes
