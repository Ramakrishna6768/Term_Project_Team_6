The majority of the setup will be completed while the code is being executed; the source code files are python notebook files. To run and code the project we uuttilized Jupyter Notebook.

The following are the names of the code files : 
1) reddit_api_script.ipynb, the source code for the Reddit API data extraction.
2) term_project_code.ipynb, this is the source code that we import the data into to do sentiment analysis. All of the results are in the notebook, and the report also includes documentation of them.

The folder named 'Project' has all the datasets and ipynb files.

Since, we have already done the data extraction, you can start by downloading the folder 'Project' and run it as we have the datasets in the same folder.
